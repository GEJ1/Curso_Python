[Biochemical studies on camomile components/III. In vitro studies about the
antipeptic activity of (--)-alpha-bisabolol (author's transl)].

[Article in German]

Isaac O, Thiemer K.

(--)-alpha-Bisabolol has a primary antipeptic action depending on dosage, which
is not caused by an alteration of the pH-value. The proteolytic activity of
pepsin is reduced by 50 percent through addition of bisabolol in the ratio of
1/0.5. The antipeptic action of bisabolol only occurs in case of direct contact. 
In case of a previous contact with the substrate, the inhibiting effect is lost.

[Demonstration of tumor inhibiting properties of a strongly immunostimulating
low-molecular weight substance. Comparative studies with ifosfamide on the
immuno-labile DS carcinosarcoma. Stimulation of the autoimmune activity for
approx. 20 days by BA 1, a N-(2-cyanoethylene)-urea. Novel prophylactic
possibilities].

[Article in German]

Ardenne M, Reitnauer PG.

A report is given on the recent discovery of outstanding immunological properties
in BA 1 [N-(2-cyanoethylene)-urea] having a (low) molecular mass M = 111.104.
Experiments in 214 DS carcinosarcoma bearing Wistar rats have shown that BA 1, at
a dosage of only about 12 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) and negligible lethality (1.7 
percent), results in a recovery rate of 40 percent without hyperglycemia and, in 
one test, of 80 percent with hyperglycemia. Under otherwise unchanged conditions 
the reference substance ifosfamide (IF) -- a further development of
cyclophosphamide -- applied without hyperglycemia in its most efficient dosage of
47 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) brought about a recovery rate of 25 percent at a
lethality of 18 percent. (Contrary to BA 1, 250-min hyperglycemia caused no
further improvement of the recovery rate.) However this comparison is
characterized by the fact that both substances exhibit two quite different
(complementary) mechanisms of action. Leucocyte counts made after application of 
the said cancerostatics and dosages have shown a pronounced stimulation with BA 1
and with ifosfamide, the known suppression in the post-therapeutic interval
usually found with standard cancerostatics. In combination with the cited plaque 
test for BA 1, blood pictures then allow conclusions on the immunity status.
Since IF can be taken as one of the most efficient cancerostatics--there is no
other chemotherapeutic known up to now that has a more significant effect on the 
DS carcinosarcoma in rats -- these findings are of special importance. Finally,
the total amount of leucocytes and lymphocytes as well as their time behaviour
was determined from the blood picture of tumour-free rats after i.v. application 
of BA 1. The thus obtained numerical values clearly show that further research
work on the prophylactic use of this substance seems to be necessary and very
promising.

Effect of etafenone on total and regional myocardial blood flow.

Flohr H, Breull W.

The distribution of blood flow to the subendocardial, medium and subepicardial
layers of the left ventricular free wall was studied in anaesthetized dogs under 
normoxic (A), hypoxic (B) conditions and under pharmacologically induced
(etafenone) coronary vasodilation (C). Regional myocardial blood flow was
determined by means of the particle distribution method. In normoxia a transmural
gradient of flow was observed, with the subendocardial layers receiving a
significantly higher flow rate compared with the subepicardial layers. In hypoxia
induced vasodilation this transmural gradient of flow was persistent. In contrast
a marked redistribution of regional flow was observed under pharmacologically
induced vasodilation. The transmural gradient decreased. In contrast to some
findings these experiments demonstrate that a considerable vasodilatory capacity 
exists in all layers of the myocardium and can be utilized by drugs. The
differences observed for the intramural distribution pattern of flow under
hypoxia and drug induced vasodilation support the hypothesis that this pattern
reflects corresponding gradients of regional myocardial metabolism.

Influence of a new virostatic compound on the induction of enzymes in rat liver.

Kröger H, Donner I, Skiello G.

The virostatic compound
N,N-diethyl-4-[2-(2-oxo-3-tetradecyl-1-imidazolidinyl)-ethyl]-1-piperazinecarboxa
mide-hydrochloride (5531) was analyzed as to its effect on the induction of
tryptophan-pyrrolase and tyrosineaminotransferase in rat liver. 1. The basic
activity of the enzymes was not influenced by the substance either in normal or
in adrenalectomized animals. 2. The induction of the enzymes by cortisone
increased in the presence of the compound whereas the substrate induction
remained unchanged. 3. The induction of tyrosine-aminotransferase by
dexamethasonephosphate in tissue culture is inhibited if the dose of compound
5531 is higher than 5 mug/ml.

Pharmacological properties of new neuroleptic compounds.

Coscia L, Causa P, Giuliani E, Nunziata A.

RMI 61 140, RMI 61 144 and RMI 61 280 are newly synthetized
N-[8-R-dibenzo(b,f)oxepin-10-yl]-N'-methyl-piperazine-maleates which show
interesting psychopharmacologic effects. This work contains the results of a
study performed with these three compounds, in order to demonstrate their
neuropsycholeptic activity in comparison with chloropromazine (CPZ) and
chlordiazepoxide (CPD). The inhibition of motility observed in mice shows that
the compounds reduce the normal spontaneous motility as well as the muscle tone. 
The central-depressant activity is evidenced by increased barbiturate-induced
sleep and a remarkable eyelid ptosis can also be observed. Our compounds do not
show any activity on electroshock just as do CPZ and CPD. As to the antipsychotic
outline, our compounds show strong reduction of lethality due to amphetamine in
grouped mice and a strong antiapomorphine activity. They show also an
antiaggressive effect and an inhibitory activity on avoidance behaviour much
stronger than CPZ. We have also found extrapyramidal effects, as catalepsy,
common to many tranquillizers of the kind of the standards used by us. As for
vegetative phenomena, the compounds show hypotensive dose related action ranging 
from moderate to strong, probably due to an a-receptor inhibition. Adrenolytic
activity against lethal doses of adrenaline, antiserotonin and antihistaminic
effects, as well as other actions (hypothermia, analgesia, etc.) confirm that RMI
61 140, RMI 61 144 and RMI 61 280 are endowed with pharmacologic properties
similar and more potent than those of CPZ. Studies on the metabolism of brain
catecholamines show that they are similar to CPZ, although with less effect on
dopamine level.

[Studies on the action of an anticholinergic agent in combination with a
tranquilizer on gastric juice secretion in man].

[Article in German]

Scherberger RR, Kaess H, Brückner S.

A double-blind study with intra-individual comparisons was carried out to
investigate the effects of 15 mg of
(8r)-3alpha-hydroxy-8-isopropyl-1alphaH-tropanium bromide(+/-)-tropate (Sch
1000), 15 mg Sch 1000 + 10 mg oxazepam, 10 mg oxazepam and placebo with oral
administration in randomized sequence on gastric juice volume, amount of acid,
concentration and pH values in 12 healthy volunteers. The secretion parameters
were measured during a 1-h basal period and a 2-h stimulation period. The gastric
juice was obtained in 15 min portions via stomach tube. Stimulation was effected 
by 1 mug/kg/h pentagastrin via drip infusion. The Friedman test was used for the 
comparative statistical evaluation, and individual comparisons were carried out
by means of the Wilcoxon test (pair-differences rank). The results show that Sch 
1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were equal in effect on basal and stimulated
secretion volume. As compared with placebo, it was not possible to establish an
effect on secretion volume for oxazepam alone. Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam
were found to be equipotent in reducing the amount of basal acid, while oxazepam 
reduced this quantity only during the first 30 min of basal secretion. None of
the three active preparations was capable of inhibiting the stimulated acid,
although both Sch 1000 preparations produced a clear trend towards lowered mean
values. During the basal secretion period, all three test preparations had an
inhibiting action on acid concentration, but none of them had a significant
effect during the stimulation period. The pH value was savely increased only by
Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam, and this even only during the basal period. The
results are discussed.

Lysosomal hydrolases of the epidermis. I. Glycosidases.

Mier PD, van den Hurk JJ.

Seven distinct glycosidases (EC 3.2) have been characterized in guinea-pig
epidermis. Their properties indicate them to be of lysosomal origin. The
'profile' of the epidermal glycosidases is significantly different from that
reported for whole skin, the activities of beta-galactosidase and
beta-acetylglucosaminidase being very high and those of the remaining enzymes
relatively low in epidermis.

A serum haemagglutinating property dependent upon polycarboxyl groups.

Beck ML, Freihaut B, Henry R, Pierce S, Bayer WL.

A serum agglutinin reactive with red cells in the presence of polycarboxyl groups
is reported. It is likely that this represents an additional example of the type 
of agglutinin previously described as agglutinating red cells in the absence of
ionized calcium. Experimental evidence is presented indicating that it is free
polycarboxyl groups that potentiate agglutination and that any metal ion, such as
calcium, capable of chelating with these groups will prove to be inhibitory.

Effect of human erythrocyte stromata on complement activation.

Corrocher R, Tedesco F, Rabusin P, De Sandre G.

Stroma from either normal or PNH-like red cells is capable of inhibiting, to some
extent, lysis in the sucrose test and enhancing lysis in the acidified-serum
test. The same opposing effects are displayed by the exclusion peaks from
Sephadex G-200 obtained from each stroma preparation, suggesting that the same
factor could be responsible for both activities. Stromata and peaks also induce
lysis of PNH-like cells in unacidified serum, indicating activation of complement
through the alternate pathway. This is confirmed by immunoelectrophoretic
observation. When serum previously activated through the alternate pathway is
used in the sucrose test the amount of lysis is markedly reduced. This would
indicate that the classical pathway activation can be controlled by the alternate
pathway. The possible clinical significance of these factors in determining the
haemolytic crisis in PNH patients is discussed.

Worathumrong N, Grimes AJ.

The effect of the major metabolite of aspirin, namely salicylic acid, upon the
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) of normal and G6PD-deficient red cells has been
studied. Salicylic acid was shown to inhibit this pathway in proportion to the
amount present. At any concentration of this substance there was greater
inhibition of the PPP in G6PD-deficient than in normal red cells.

The effects of processing of barley-based supplements on rumen pH, rate of
digestion of voluntary intake of dried grass in sheep.

Orskov ER, Fraser C.

1. In one experiment the effect on rumen pH of feeding with restricted amounts of
whole or pelleted barley was studied. With whole barley there was little
variation in rumen pH associated with feeding time, but with pelleted barley the 
pH decreased from about 7-0 before feeding to about 5-3, 2--3 h after feeding. 2.
The rate of disappearance of dried grass during incubation in the rumens of sheep
receiving either whole or pelleted barley was studied in a second experiment.
After 24 h incubation only 423 mg/g incubated had disappeared in the rumen of
sheep receiving pelleted barley while 625 mg/g incubated had disappeared when it 
was incubated in the rumen of sheep receiving whole barley. 3. The voluntary
intake of dried grass of lambs was studied in a third experiment when they
received supplements of either 25 or 50 g whole or pelleted barley/kg live weight
0-75. At the high level, pelleted barley reduced intake of dried grass by 534
g/kg but whole barley reduced it by only 352 g/kg. The digestibility of
acid-detergent fibre was reduced more by pelleted barley than by whole barley but
there was a tendency for a small increase in digestibility of the barley due to
processing. 4. The implications of these findings on supplementation of roughages
with cereals are discussed.

Poly(8-aminoguanylic acid): formation of ordered self-structures and interaction 
with poly(cytidylic acid).

Hattori M, Frazier J, Miles HT.

Poly(8-aminoguanylic acid) has in neutral solution a novel ordered structure of
high stability. The 8-amino group permits formation of three hydrogen bonds
between two residues along the "top", or long axis, of the purines. The usual
hydrogen bonding protons and Watson-Crick pairing sites are not involved in the
association. The bonding scheme has a twofold rotation axis and is hemiprotonated
at N(7). Poly(8NH2G) is converted by alkaline titration (pK = 9.7) to a quite
different ordered structure, which is the favored form over the range
approximately pH 10-11. The bonding scheme appears to be composed of a planar,
tetrameric array of guanine residues, in which the 8-amino group does not
participate in interbase hydrogen bonding. Poly (8NH2G) does not interact with
poly(C) in neutral solution because of the high stability of the hemiprotonated
G-G self-structure. Titration to the alkaline plateau, however, permits ready
formation of a two-stranded Watson-Crick helix. In contrast to the monomer
8NH2GMP, poly(8NH2G) does not form a triple helix with poly(C) under any
conditions. The properties of the ordered structures are interpreted in terms of 
a strong tendency of the 8-amino group to form a third interbase hydrogen bond,
when this possibility is not prevented by high pH.

Effect of pH on substrate and inhibitor kinetic constants of human liver alanine 
aminopeptidase. Evidence for two ionizable active center groups.

Garner CW, Behal FJ.

The presence of at least two ionizable active center groups has been detected by 
a study of the effect of pH upon catalysis of hydrolysis of
L-alanyl-beta-naphthylamide by human liver alanine aminopeptidase and upon the
inhibition of hydrolysis by inhibitors and substrate analogs. Octanoic acid,
octylamine, and peptide inhibitors have been found to be competitive inhibitors
and are therefore thought to bind the active center. L-Phe was previously shown
to bind the active center since it was found to be a competitive inhibitor of the
hydrolysis of tripeptide substrates (Garner, C. W., and Behal, F. J. (1975),
Biochemistry 14, 3208). A plot of pKm vs. pH for the substrate
L-Ala-beta-naphthylamide showed that binding decreased below pH 5.9 and above
7.5, the points at which the theoretical curve undergoes an integral change in
slope. These points are interpreted as the pKa either of substrate ionizable
groups or binding-dependent enzyme active center groups. Similar plots of pKm vs.
pH for L-alanyl-p-nitroanilide (as substrate) and pKi vs. pH for
L-Leu-L-Leu-L-Leu and D-Leu-L-Tyr (as inhibitors) gave pairs fo pKa values of 5.8
and 7.4, 6.0 and 7.5, and 5.7 and 7.5, respectively. All the above substrates
(and D-Leu-L-Tyr) have pKa values near 7.5; therefore, the binding-dependent
group with a pKa value near 7.5 is possibly this substrate group. Similar plots
of pKi vs. pH for the inhibitors L-Phe, L-Met, L-Leu, octylamine, and octanoic
acid had only one bending point at 7.7, 7.6, 7.4, 6.3, and 5.9, respectively.
Amino acid inhibitors, octylamine, and octanoic acid have no groups with pKa
values between 5 and 9. These data indicate that there are two active center
ionizable groups with pKa values of approximately 6.0 and 7.5 which are involved 
in substrate binding or inhibitory amino acid binding but not in catalysis since 
Vmax was constant at all pH values tested.

Formation of transient complexes in the glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzed
reaction.

Sanner T.

The reaction of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate (gl) with NAD+ and NADP+
has been studied with stopped-flow techniques. The enzyme was in all experiments 
present in excess of the coenzyme. The results indicate that the ternary complex 
(E-NAD(P)H-kg) is present as an intermediate in the formation of the stable
complex (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The identification of the complexes is based on their
absorption spectra. The binding of the coenzyme to (E-gl) is the rate-limiting
step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) while the dissociation of
alpha-ketoglutarate (kg) from this complex is the rate-limiting step in the
formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The Km for glutamate was 20-25 mM in the first
reaction and 3 mM in the formation of the stable complex. The Km values were
independent of the coenzyme. The reaction rates with NAD+ were approximately 50% 
greater than those with NADP+. Furthermore, high glutamate concentration
inhibited the formation of (E-NADH-kg) while no substrate inhibition was found
with NADP+ as coenzyme. ADP enhanced while GTP reduced the rate of (E-NAD(P)H-gl)
formation. The rate of formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) was inhibited by ADP, while it
increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of GTP were added.
The results show that the higher activity found with NAD+ compared to NADP+ under
steady-state assay conditions do not necessarily involve binding of NAD+ to the
ADP activating site of the enzyme. Moreover, the substrate inhibition found at
high glutamate concentration under steady-state assay condition is not due to the
formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) as this complex is formed with Km of 3 mM glutamate, 
and the substrate inhibition is only significant at 20-30 times this
concentration.

Human brain and placental choline acetyltransferase: purification and properties.

Roskoski R Jr, Lim CT, Roskoski LM.

Choline acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6) catalyzes the biosynthesis of
acetylcholine according to the following chemical equation: acetyl-CoA + choline 
in equilibrium to acetylcholine + CoA. In addition to nervous tissue, primate
placenta is the only other animal source which contains appreciable acetylcholine
and its biosynthetic enzyme. Human brain caudate nucleus and human placental
choline acetyltransferase were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using
ion-exchange and blue dextran-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The molecular
weights determined by Sephadex G-150 gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate
gel electrophoresis are 67000 plus or minus 3000. N-Ethylmaleimide,
p-chloromercuribenzoate, and dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) inhibit the enzyme.
Dithiothreitol reverses the inhibition produced by the latter two reagents. The
pKa of the group associated with N-ethylmaleimide inhibition is 8.6 plus or minus
0.3. A chemically competent acetyl-thioenzyme is isolable by Sephadex gel
filtration. The enzymes from the brain and placenta are thus far physically and
biochemically indistinguishable.

Stabilization of the globular structure of ferricytochrome c by chloride in
acidic solvents.

Stellwagen E, Babul J.

Increasing concentrations of chloride were found to increase the resolution
between two visible absorbance spectral transitions associated with acidification
of ferricytochrome c. Analysis of a variety of spectral and viscosity
measurements indicates that protonation of a single group having an apparent pK
of 2.1 +/- 0.2 and an intrinsic pK of about 5.3 displaces the methionine ligand
without significantly perturbing the native globular conformation. Analysis of
methylated ferricytochrome c suggests that protonation of a carboxylate ion, most
likely a heme propionate residue, is responsible for displacement of the
methionine ligand. Addition of a proton to a second group having an apparent pK
of 1.2 +/- 0.1 displaces the histidine ligand and unfolds the protein from a
globular conformation into a random coil. It is most likely that the second
protonation occurs on the imidazole ring of the histidine ligand itself. Chloride
is proposed to perturb these transitions by ligation in the fifth coordination
position of the heme ion. Such ligation stabilizes a globular conformation of
ferricytochrome c at pH 0.0 and 25 degrees.

A competitive labeling method for the determination of the chemical properties of
solitary functional groups in proteins.

Duggleby RG, Kaplan H.

The properties of the functional groups in a protein can be used as
built-in-probes of the structure of the protein. We have developed a general
procedure whereby the ionization constant and chemical reactivity of solitary
functional groups in proteins may be determined. The method may be applied to the
side chain of histidine, tyrosine, lysine, and cysteine, as well as to the amino 
terminus of the protein. The method, which is an extension of the competitive
labeling technique using [3H]- and [14C]1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (N2ph-F) in a
double-labeling procedure, is rapid and sensitive. Advantage is taken of the fact
that after acid hydrolysis of a dinitrophenylated protein, a derivative is
obtained which must be derived from a unique position in the protein. The method 
has been applied to the solitary histidine residue of lysozyme, alpha-lytic
protease, and Streptomyces griseus (S.G.) trypsin, as well as to the amino
terminus of the latter protein. The following parameters were obtained for
reaction with N2ph-F at 20 degrees C in 0.1 N KCl: the histidine of hen egg-white
lysozyme, pKa of 6.4 and second-order velocity constant of 0.188 M-1 min-1; the
histidine of alpha-lytic protease, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant 
of 0.0235 M-1 min-1; the histidine of S.G. trypsin, pKa of 6.5 and second-order
velocity constant of 0.0328 M-1 min-1; the valyl amino terminus of S.G. trypsin, 
pKa of 8.1 and second-order velocity constant of 0.403 M-1 min-1. In addition,
the results obtained provide clues as to the microenvironments of these
functional groups, and indicate that the proteins studied undergo pH-dependent
conformational changes which affect the microenvironment, and hence the chemical 
reactivity of these groups.

Modification of arginine and lysine in proteins with 2,4-pentanedione.

Gilbert HF 3rd, O'Leary MH.

Primary amines react with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 6-9 to form enamines,
N-alkyl-4-amino-3-penten-2-ones. The latter compounds readily regenerate the
primary amine at low pH or on treatment with hydroxylamine. Guanidine and
substituted guanidines react with 2,4-pentanedione to form N-substituted
2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidines at a rate which is lower by at least a factor of 
20 than the rate of reaction of 2,4-pentanedione with primary amines. Selective
modification of lysine and arginine side chains in proteins can readily be
achieved with 2,4-pentanedione. Modification of lysine is favored by reaction at 
pH 7 or for short reaction times at pH 9. Selective modification of arginine is
achieved by reaction with 2,4-pentanedione for long times at pH 9, followed by
treatment of the protein with hydroxylamine. The extent of modification of lysine
and arginine side chains can readily be measured spectrophotometrically.
Modification of lysozyme with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 7 results in modification of
3.8 lysine residues and less than 0.4 arginine residue in 24 hr. Modification of 
lysozyme with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 9 results in modification of 4 lysine
residues and 4.5 arginine residues in 100 hr. Treatment of this modified protein 
with hydroxylamine regenerated the modified lysine residues but caused no change 
in the modified arginine residues. One arginine residue seems to be essential for
the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

The origin of the alkaline inactivation of pepsinogen.

McPhie P.

Above pH 8.5, pepsinogen is converted into a form which cannot be activated to
pepsin on exposure to low pH. Intermediate exposure to neutral pH, however,
returns the protein to a form which can be activated. Evidence is presented for a
reversible, small conformational change in the molecule, distinct from the
unfolding of the protein. At the same time, the molecule is converted to a form
of limited solubility, which is precipitated at low pH, where activation is
normally seen. The results are interpreted in terms of the peculiar structure of 
the pepsinogen molecule. Titration of the basic NH2-terminal region produced an
open form, which can return to the native form at neutral pH, but which is
maintained at low pH by neutralization of carboxylate groups in the pepsin
portion.

Bovine liver dihydrofolate reductase: purification and properties of the enzyme.

Peterson DL, Gleisner JM, Blakley RL.

A purification procedure is reported for obtaining bovine liver dihydrofolate
reductase in high yield and amounts of 100-200 mg. A key step in the procedure is
the use of an affinity gel prepared by coupling pteroyl-L-lysine to Sepharose.
The purified reductase has a specific activity of about 100 units/mg and is
homogeneous as judged by analytical ultracentrifugation, polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, and titration with methotrexate. The products of the first step 
of Edman degradation indicated a minimum purity of 79%. The reductase has a
molecular weight of about 21500 on the basis of amino acid composition and 22100 
+/- 300 from equilibrium sedimentation. It is not inhibited by antiserum to the
Streptococcus faecium reductase (isoenzyme 2). Unlike the reductase of many other
vertebrate tissues, the bovine enzyme is inhibited by mercurials rather than
activated and it has a single pH optimum at both low and high ionic strength.
However, the position of the pH optimum is shifted and the activity increased by 
increasing ionic strength. Automatic Edman degradation has been used to determine
34 of the amino-terminal 37 amino acid residues. Considerable homology exists
between this region and the corresponding regions of the reductase from S.
faecium and from Escherichia coli. This strengthens the idea that this region
contributes to the structure of the binding site for dihydrofolate.

Purification and properties of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase.

Baccanari D, Phillips A, Smith S, Sinski D, Burchall J.

Dihydrofolate reductase has been purified 40-fold to apparent homogeneity from a 
trimethoprim-resistant strain of Escherichia coli (RT 500) using a procedure that
includes methotrexate affinity column chromatography. Determinations of the
molecular weight of the enzyme based on its amino acid composition, sedimentation
velocity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis gave values of 17680,
17470 and 18300, respectively. An aggregated form of the enzyme with a low
specific activity can be separated from the monomer by gel filtration; treatment 
of the aggregate with mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol results in an increase in
enzymic activity and a regeneration of the monomer. Also, multiple molecular
forms of the monomer have been detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
The unresolved enzyme exhibits two pH optima (pH 4.5 and pH 7.0) with
dihydrofolate as a substrate. Highest activities are observed in buffers
containing large organic cations. In 100 mM imidazolium chloride (pH 7), the
specific activity is 47 mumol of dihydrofolate reduced per min per mg at 30
degrees. Folic acid also serves as a substrate with a single pH optimum of pH
4.5. At this pH the Km for folate is 16 muM, and the Vmax is 1/1000 of the rate
observed with dihydrofolate as the substrate. Monovalent cations (Na+, K+, Rb+,
and Cs+) inhibit dihydrofolate reductase; at a given ionic strength the degree of
inhibition is a function of the ionic radius of the cation. Divalent cations are 
more potent inhibitors; the I50 of BaCl2 is 250 muM, as compared to 125 mM for
KCl. Anions neither inhibit nor activate the enzyme.

The influence of pH on the interaction of inhibitors with triosephosphate
isomerase and determination of the pKa of the active-site carboxyl group.

Hartman FC, LaMuraglia GM, Tomozawa Y, Wolfenden R.

Ionization effects on the binding of the potential transition state analogues
2-phosphoglycolate and 2-phosphoglycolohydroxamate appear to be attributable to
the changing state of ionization of the ligands themselves, therefore it is
unnecessary to postulate the additional involvement of an ionizing residue at the
active site of triosephosphate isomerase to explain the influence of changing pH 
on Ki in the neutral range. The binding of the competitive inhibitor inorganic
sulfate is insensitive to changing pH in the neutral range. 3-Chloroacetol
sulfate, synthesized as an active-site-specific reagent for triosephosphate
isomerase, is used to provide an indication of the pKa of the essential carboxyl 
group of this enzyme. Previously described active-site-specific reagents for the 
isomerase were phosphate esters, and their changing state of ionization
(accompanied by possible changes in their affinity for the active site) may have 
complicated earlier attempts to determine the pKa of the essential carboxyl group
from the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation. Being a strong monoprotic
acid, chloroacetol sulfate is better suited to the determination of the pKa of
the carboxyl group. Chloroacetol sulfate inactivates triosephosphate isomerase by
the selective esterification of the same carboxyl group as that which is
esterified by the phosphate esters described earlier. From the pH dependence of
the rate of inactivation of yeast triosephosphate isomerase, the apparent pKa of 
the active-site carboxyl group is estimated as 3.9 +/- 0.1.

Monoanion inhibition and 35Cl nuclear magnetic resonance studies of renal
dipeptidase.

Ferren LG, Ward RL, Campbell BJ.

Kinetic analyses of monoanion inhibition and 15Cl nuclear magnetic resonance at
5.88 MHz were employed to study monoanion interactions with the zinc
metalloenzyme, renal dipeptidase. The enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of
glycyldehydrophenylalanine exhibited competitive inhibition when the reaction
rate was determined in the presence of the monovalent anions fluoride, chloride, 
bromide, iodide, azide, nitrate, or thiocyanate or upon the addition of the
divalent anion, sulfate. Competitive inhibition was produced by these anions. One
anion was bound per enzyme molecule, and except in the case of fluoride all of
the anions appeared to bind at the same site. Cyanide ion produced a much more
effective inhibition of renal dipeptidase than the other monoanions, and it was
shown that two cyanide ions were bound per enzyme molecule. An investigation of
the effect of pH upon monoanion inhibition suggested that the anion inhibitors
bind to the group with a pK of approximately 7.8. Complete dissociation of this
group (approximately pH 8.4) eliminates the inhibitory effect of anions. The 35Cl
line broadening produced by renal dipeptidase in 0.5 M NaCl solutions was 100
times more effective than that produced by equivalent concentrations of
aquozinc(II). The line broadening was dependent upon the concentration of the
metalloenzyme and independent of the frequency of the exciting radiation. When
zinc ion was removed from the metalloenzyme by dialysis or when chloride was
titrated from the metalloenzyme by cyanide, line broadening was decreased.
Treatment of renal dipeptidase with saturating concentrations of the competitive 
inhibitor, guanosine triphosphate, in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl also produced a 
significant decrease in the 35Cl line width. The 35Cl line broadening produced by
renal dipeptidase was shown to decrease with increasing pH through the range pH
5.8-10.8. This line-width variation with pH appeared to result from the titration
of a site on the metalloprotein with an approximate pK of 7.4. Temperature
studies of 35Cl line broadening by the metalloenzyme in the presence of chloride 
and cyanide inhibitors suggest that the fast exchange process pertains and that
the dominant relaxation mechanism is quadrupolar in nature.

The interaction of bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase with hydrogen
peroxide: inactivation of the enzyme.

Hodgson EK, Fridovich I.

Bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase was slowly and irreversibly inactivated
by hydrogen peroxide. The rate of this inactivation was directly dependent upon
the concentrations of both H2O2 and of enzyme, and its second-order rate constant
at pH 10.0 and 25 degrees was 6.7 M-1 sec-1. Inactivation was preceded by a
bleaching due to rapid reduction of Cu2+ on the enzyme, and following this there 
was a gradual reappearance of a new absorption in the visible region, which was
coincident with the loss of catalytic activity. Inactivation of the enzyme was
pH-dependent and indicated an essential ionization whose pKa was approximately
10.2. Replacement of H2O by D2O raised this pKa but did not diminish the
catalytic activity of superoxide dismutase, measured at pH 10.0. Several
compounds, including xanthine, urate, formate, and azide, protected the enzyme
against inactivation by H2O2. Alcohols and benzoate, which scavenge hydroxyl
radical, did not protect. Compounds with special affinity for singlet oxygen were
similarly ineffective. The data were interpreted in terms of the reduction of the
enzyme-bound Cu2+ to Cu+, by H2O2, followed by a Fenton's type reaction of the
Cu+ with additional H2O2. This would generate Cu2+-OH- or its ionized equivalent,
Cu2+-O--, which could then oxidatively attack an adjacent histidine and thus
inactivate the enzyme. Compounds which protected the enzyme could have done so by
reacting with the bound oxidant, in competition with the adjacent histidine.

Circular dichroism and fluorescence studies of homogeneous antibodies to type III
pneumococcal polysaccharide.

Jaton JC, Huser H, Blatt Y, Pecht I.

The near-ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD) of three homogeneous anti-type III
pneumococcal antibodies in the absence and the presence of the specific
hexasaccharide ligand was studied. In addition recombinations and hybridizations 
of H and L chains derived from two of these antibodies were carried out and the
CD spectra of bound and free reconstituted IgG molecules were measured. The
results indicate that the CD spectra of the native antibodies in the 260-310-nm
range are very similar in shape and sign and exhibit a positive band at 285 nm.
The homologous reconstituted antibody molecules exhibited CD spectra very similar
in shape and sign to those of the native antibody molecules although recombinant 
molecules are no longer stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds. Upon addition
of the hexasaccharide ligand, a significant decrease in amplitude of the CD
spectra (18-21%) occurred in all three native antibodies and their Fab fragments 
as well as in the homologous recombinant molecules. No CD spectral changes could 
be detected upon interaction of the hapten ligand with the heterologous
recombinants. All homogeneous antibodies studied exhibited fluorescence quenching
upon oligosaccharide binding and a blue shift of the emission maximum. This
property allowed the determination of the binding constant of one selected
antibody to be made. Taken together, CD and fluorescence spectroscopic data
suggest that oligosaccharide ligands induced detectable conformational changes in
the Fab fragment of the antibody.

Conformational changes induced in a homogeneous anti-type III pneumococcal
antibody by oligosaccharides of increasing size.

Jaton JC, Huser H, Braun DG, Givol D, Pecht I, Schlessinger J.

The circular polarization of luminescence (CPL) emitted by tryptophan residues
was used as a sensitive probe for measuring ligand-induced structural changes in 
a homogeneous type III pneumococcal antibody. A series of oligosaccharide ligands
of increasing size derived from type III polysaccharide by partial acid
hydrolysis was assayed. Ligand-induced changes in the circular polarization of
fluorescence of the antibody were observed for all antigens tested, including
tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides and a 16-residue oligomer, the largest changes
being recorded upon interaction with the intact soluble type III pneumococcal
(SIII) polysaccharide. When Fab' or F(ab')2 fragments were used instead of the
antibody IgG for binding of SIII polysaccharide, the extent of conformational
changes was decreased. This suggests interactions between Fab and Fc portions in 
the IgG molecule and subsequent conformational changes in Fc part upon antigen
binding. Reduction of interchain disulfide bonds abolished the additional
spectral changes attributed to the Fc part but not the changes observed in the
Fab part, thus suggesting that the presence of the interchain disulfide bond in
the hinge region is required for maximal CPL changes to occur. Small monovalent
ligands, i.e., the tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides, were capable of inducing
CPL changes in the Fab part of the antibody molecule as well as CPL changes
attributed to the Fc portion. A multivalent ligand containing about 16 sugar
residues appears to be the minimal antigenic size required for triggering
conformational changes attributed to the Fc part, similar to those seen in the
interaction with the whole polysaccharide antigen.

The functional role of the Bacillus stearothermophilus 50S ribosomal protein B-L3
(probably homologous to the Escherichia coli protein L2) was examined by chemical
modification. The complex [B-L3-23S RNA] was photooxidized in the presence of
rose bengal and the modified protein incorporated by reconstitution into 50S
ribosomal subunits containing all other unmodified components. Particles
containing photooxidized B-L3 are defective in several functional assays,
including (1) poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis, (2) peptidyltransferase
activity, (3) ability to associate with a [30S-poly(U)-Phe-tRNA] complex, and (4)
binding of elongation factor G and GTP. The rates of loss of the partial
functional activities during photooxidation of B-L3 indicate that at least two
independent inactivating events are occurring, a faster one, involving oxidation 
of one or more histidine residues, affecting peptidyltransferase and subunit
association activities and a slower one affecting EF-G binding. Therefore the
protein B-L3 has one or more histidine residues which are essential for
peptidyltransferase and subunit association, and another residue which is
essential for EF-G-GTP binding. B-L3 may be the ribosomal peptidyltransferase
protein, or a part of the active site, and may contribute functional groups to
the other active sites as well.

The interaction of phospholipase A2 with micellar interfaces. The role of the
N-terminal region.

van Dam-Mieras MC, Slotboom AJ, Pieterson WA, de Haas GH.

The localization of the previously postulated interface recognition site (IRS) in
porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2, required for a specific interaction between 
the enzyme and organized lipid-water interfaces, was investigated by ultraviolet 
difference spectroscopy, by measurements of the intrinsic fluorescence of the
unique Trp residue, and by protection experiments against specific tryptic
hydrolysis. Using the enzymically nondegradable substrate analogues:
CnH(2n+1)(0-)OOCH2CH2N+(CH3)3-(H,OH), it is shown that the rather hydrophobic
N-terminal sequence of the enzyme, viz., Ala-Leu-Trp-Gln-Phe-Arg, is directly
involved in the interaction with the lipid-water interface. Besides hydrophobic
probably also polar interactions contribute to the binding process. At neutral or
acidic pH the presence of a salt bridge between the N-terminal alpha-NH3+ group
and a negatively charged side chain stablizes the interface recognition site and 
allows the enzyme to penetrate micellar surfaces, even in the absence of metal
ion. At alkaline pH, interaction of the enzyme with micellar interfaces requires 
the presence of Ca2+ (Ba2+) ions.

Phospholipase A2 as a probe of phospholipid distribution in erythrocyte
membranes. Factors influencing the apparent specificity of the reaction.

Martin JK, Luthra MG, Wells MA, Watts RP, Hanahan DJ.

The action of snake venom phospholipases A2 in intact human erythrocytes was
investigated in detail. The basis phospholipase from Agkistrodon halys blomhifii 
was found to induce both hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and total cell
hemolysis under certain experimental conditions. The hydrolytic action of the
basic enzyme was found to consist of two sequential events: (a) hydrolysis of 70%
of the total cell ph osphatidylcholine without any evident hemolysis; and (b)
complete hydrolysis of the remaining phosphatidylcholine, followed closely by
extensive phosphatidylethanolamine hydrolysis and finally with onset of
hemolysis, attack on the phosphatidylserine. At pH 7.4 and 10 mM Ca2+ only stage 
(a) occurred. However, a slight elevation of the pH of incubation to pH 8.0
and/or inclusion of 40 mM Ca2+ in the reaction mixture caused both events (a) and
(b) to occur. The addition of glucose limited the action of the enzyme to stage
(a) under any reaction conditions. An investigation showed that enzymically
induced hemolysis occurred under conditions where the intracellular ATP levels
were lowered. Data are presented which suggest that stage (b) is mediated by in
influx of Ca2+ into the cell when the levels of ATP are low. Interestingly the
phosphllipase from Naja naja venom (Pakistan) yielded results similar to those
observed with the basic enzyme from Agkistrodon venom. However, the enzyme from
Crotalus adamanteus and the acidic enzyme also present in the Agkistrodon venom
produced only slight hydrolysis or hemolysis under any of the conditions studied.
Other species of erythrocytes, e.g., guinea pig, monkey, pig, and rat, were
tested but only those from guinea pig behaved similarly to the human cells. Pig, 
monkey, and rat erythrocytes underwent very limited hydrolysis and hemolysis. It 
is evident that the use of these phospholipases to probe the localization of
phospholipds in erythrocyte membranes must be approached with caution. Certain
facets of this problem are discussed.

Subunit interactions in yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

Mockrin SC, Byers LD, Koshland DE Jr.

The spontaneous inactivation of yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
was found to fit a simple two-state model at pH 8.5 and 25 degrees. The first
step is a relatively rapid dissociation of the tetramer to dimers with the
equilibrium largely in favor of the tetramer. In the absence of NAD+ the dimer
inactivates irreversibly. The apoenzyme is quite stable with a half-life for
complete activity loss proportional to the square root of the enzyme
concentration. Perturbances of the protein structure (by pH, ionic strength, and 
specific salts), which have no effect on the tetrameric state of the molecule,
result in an alteration of the cooperativity of NAD+ binding, the reactivity of
the active-site sulfhydryl group, and the catalytic activity of the enzyme.
Covalent modification of two of the four active-site sulfhydryl groups has
profound effects on the enzymic activity which are mediated by changes in the
subunit interactions. Sedimentation analysis and hybridization studies indicate
that the interaction between subunits remains strong after covalent modification.
Under normal physiological and equilibrium dialysis conditions the protein is a
tetramer. Equilibrium dialysis studies of NAD+ binding to the enzyme at pH 8.5
and 25 degrees reveal a mixed cooperativity pattern. A model consistent with
these observations and the observed half-of-the-sites reactivity is that of
ligand induced sequential conformational changes which are transferred across
strongly interacting subunit domains. Methods for distinguishing negatively
cooperative binding patterns from mixtures of denatured enzyme and multiple
species are discussed.

Kinetic light scattering studies on the dissociation of hemoglobin from Lumbricus
terrestris.

Goss DJ, Parkhurst LJ, Görisch H.

The kinetics of the pH-induced dissociation of the 3 X 10(6) mol wt hemoglobin
from Lumbricus terrestris (the earthworm) have been studied in a light-scattering
stopped-flow apparatus. The ligand dependent dissociation data were fit well by a
simple sequential model. The data for CO and oxyhemoglobin are consistent with
Hb12 leads to 2Hb6 leads to 12Hb. Methemoglobin at pH 7 appears to be hexameric
and the dissociation is consistent with the model: Hb6 leads to 6Hb. In a
sequential decay scheme for which light-scattering changes are monitored, the
relative amounts of rapid and slow phase are determined by the rate constants as 
well as the molecular weights of intermediate species. Assignment of the
hexameric intermediate is supported by an investigation of the sensitivity of the
theoretical kinetic curves to the molecular weights of the intermediates. This
assignment is further supported by the following: (1) the same model will fit the
data for oxy- and CO-hemoglobin at all three temperatures (a 24-29-fold variation
in rate constants), (2) evidence from electron microscopy shows hexameric forms, 
and (3) methemoglobin is apparently stable as a hexamer at pH 7. When CO replaces
O2 as the ligand, the dissociation rate increases by a factor of four. The met is
about 20 times faster than the initial oxyhemoglobin dissociation rate, but
perhaps more relevant for comparing dissociation of the hexamer, the met rate was
respectively 100 times and 500 times faster than that for the assumed hexameric
forms of CO- and oxy-hemoglobin. The activation energies for the dodecamer to
hexamer dissociation and for the dissociation of the hexamer to smaller forms
were about 30 kcal/mol for oxy-, CO-, and methemoglobin.

The reversible reduction of horse metmyoglobin by the iron(II) complex of
trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N,n-tetraacetate.

Cassatt JC, Marini CP, Bender JW.

The reduction of metmyoglobin by the iron(II) complex of
trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetate (FeCDTA2-) has been
investigated. The equilibrium constant, measured spectrophotometrically, is 0.21 
with a resulting reduction potential of 0.050 V for Mb0. The rate constant for
the reduction is 28 M-1 sec-1 with a deltaH ++ of 13 kcal M-1 and deltaS ++ of
-11 eu. Both CN- and OH- inhibit the reduction because of the relatively low
reactivity of cyanometmyoglobin (Mb+CN-) and ionized metmyglobin (Mb+OH-). The
rate constant for the reduction of Mb+CN- by FeCDTA2- is 4.0 X 10(-2) M-1 sec-1
and that for reduction of Mb+OH- is 4.8 M-1 sec-1. The nitric oxide complex of
metmyoglobin is reduced with a rate constant of 10 M-1 sec-1. The kinetics of
oxidation of oxymyoglobin by FeCDTA- were studied. The data are consistent with a
mechanism where oxidation takes place entirely through the deoxy form. A rate
constant of 1.45 X 10(2) M-1 sec-1 was calculated for the oxidation of
deoxymyoglobin by FeCDTA-, in equilibrium constant and rate constant for
reduction. The above data are discussed in terms of a simple outer-sphere
reduction reaction.

Constitution and properties of axonal membranes of crustacean nerves.

Balerna M, Fosset M, Chicheportiche R, Romey G, Lazdunski M.

The purification of axonal membranes of crustaceans was followed by measuring
enrichment in [3H]tetrodotoxin binding capacity and in Na+, K+-ATPase activity. A
characteristic of these membranes is their high content of lipids and their low
content of protein as compared to other types of plasmatic membranes. The axonal 
membrane contains myosin-like, actin-like, tropomyosin-like, and tubulin-like
proteins. It also contains Na+, K+-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase. The molecular
weights of these two enzymes after solubilization are 280,000 and 270,000,
respectively. The molecular weights of the catalytic subunits are 96,000 for
ATPase and 71,000 for acetylcholinesterase. We confirmed the presence of a
nicotine binding component in the axonal membrane of the lobster but we have been
unable to find [3H]nicotine binding to crab axonal membranes. The binding to
axonal membranes og of the sodium channel, has been studied in detail. The
dissociation constant for the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to the axonal membrane 
receptor is 2.9 nM at pH 7.4. The concentration of the tetrodotoxin receptor in
crustacean membranes is about 10 pmol/mg of membrane protein, 7 times less than
the acetylcholinesterase, 30 times less than the Na+, K+-ATPase, and 30 times
less than the nicotine binding component in the lobster membrane. A reasonable
estimate indicates that approximately only one peptide chain in 1000 constitutes 
the tetrodotoxin binding part of the sodium channel in the axonal membrane.
Veratridine, which acts selectively on the resting sodium permeability, binds to 
the phospholipid part of the axonal membrane. [3H]Veratridine binding to
membranes parallels the electrophysiological effect. Veratridine and tetrodotoxin
have different receptor sites. Although tetrodotoxin can repolarize the excitable
membrane of a giant axon depolarized by veratridine, veratridine does not affect 
the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to purified axonal membranes. Similarly,
tetrodotoxin does not affect the binding of [3H]veratridine to axonal membranes. 
Scorpion neurotoxin I, a presynaptic toxin which affects both the Na+ and the K+ 
channels, does not interfere with the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin or
[3H]veratridine to axonal membranes. Tetrodotoxin, veratridine, and scorpion
neurotoxin I, which have in common the perturbation of the normal functioning of 
the sodium channel, act upon three different types of receptor sites.

Regulation of nitrogen fixation. Nitrogenase-derepressed mutants of Klebsiella
pneumoniae.

Shanmugam KT, Chan I, Morandi C.

1. A new procedure is described for selecting nitrogenase-derepressed mutants
based on the method of Brenchley et al. (Brenchley, J.E., Prival, M.J. and
Magasanik, B. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6122-6128) for isolating
histidase-constitutive mutants of a non-N2-fixing bacterium. 2. Nitrogenase
levels of the new mutants in the presence of NH4+ were as high as 100% of the
nitrogenase activity detected in the absence of NH4+. 3. Biochemical
characterization of these nitrogen fixation (nif) derepressed mutants reveals
that they fall into three classes. Three mutants (strains SK-24, 28 and 29),
requiring glutamate for growth, synthesize nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase
constitutively (in the presence of NH4+). A second class of mutants (strains
SK-27 and 37) requiring glutamine for growth produces derepressed levels of
nitrogenase activity and synthesized catalytically inactive glutamine synthetase 
protein, as determined immunologically. A third class of glutamine-requiring,
nitrogenase-derepressed mutants (strain SK-25 and 26) synthesizes neither a
catalytically active glutamine synthetase enzyme nor an immunologically
cross-reactive glutamine synthetase protein. 4. F-prime complementation analysis 
reveals that the mutant strains SK-25, 26, 27, 37 map in a segment of the
Klebsiella chromosome corresponding to the region coding for glutamine
synthetase. Since the mutant strains SK-27 and SK-37 produce inactive glutamine
synthetase protein, it is concluded that these mutations map within the glutamine
synthetase structural gene.

The reaction between the superoxide anion radical and cytochrome c.

Butler J, Jayson GG, Swallow AJ.

1. The superoxide anion radical (O2-) reacts with ferricytochrome c to form
ferrocytochrome c. No intermediate complexes are observable. No reaction could be
detected between O2- and ferrocytochrome c. 2. At 20 degrees C the rate constant 
for the reaction at pH 4.7 to 6.7 is 1.4-10(6) M-1. S -1 and as the pH increases 
above 6.7 the rate constant steadily decreases. The dependence on pH is the same 
for tuna heart and horse heart cytochrome c. No reaction could be demonstrated
between O2- and the form of cytochrome c which exists above pH approximately 9.2.
The dependence of the rate constant on pH can be explained if cytochrome c has
pKs of 7.45 and 9.2, and O2- reacts with the form present below pH 7.45 with k = 
1.4-10(6) M-1 - S-1, the form above pH 7.45 with k = 3.0- 10(5) M-1 - S-1, and
the form present above pH 9.2 with k = 0. 3. The reaction has an activation
energy of 20 kJ mol-1 and an enthalpy of activation at 25 degrees C of 18 kJ
mol-1 both above and below pH 7.45. It is suggested that O2- may reduce
cytochrome c through a track composed of aromatic amino acids, and that little
protein rearrangement is required for the formation of the activated complex. 4. 
No reduction of ferricytochrome c by HO2 radicals could be demonstrated at pH
1.2-6.2 but at pH 5.3, HO2 radicals oxidize ferrocytochrome c with a rate
constant of about 5-10(5)-5-10(6) M-1 - S-1.

Identification of the 120 mus phase in the decay of delayed fluorescence in
spinach chloroplasts and subchloroplast particles as the intrinsic back reaction.
The dependence of the level of this phase on the thylakoids internal pH.

Haveman J, Lavorel J.

After a 500 mus laser flash a 120 mus phase in the decay of delayed fluorescence 
is visible under a variety of circumstances in spinach chloroplasts and
subchloroplast particles enriched in Photosystem II prepared by means of
digitonin. The level of this phase is high in the case of inhibition of oxygen
evolution at the donor side of Photosystem II. Comparison with the results of
Babcock and Sauer (1975) Biochim. Bio-phys. Acta 376, 329-344, indicates that
their EPR signal IIf which they suppose to be due to Z+, the oxidized first
secondary donor of Photosystem II, is well correlated with a large amplitude of
our 120 mus phase. We explain our 120 mus phase by the intrinsic back reaction of
the excited reaction center in the presence of Z+, as predicted by Van Gorkom and
Donze (1973) Photochem. Photobiol. 17, 333-342. The redox state of Z+ is
dependent on the internal pH of the thylakoids. The results on the effect of pH
in the mus region are compared with those obtained in the ms region.

Light-induced changes of absorbance and electron spin resonance in small
photosystem II particles.

Van Gorkom HJ, Pulles MP, Wessels JS.

Photosystem II reaction center components have been studied in small system II
particles prepared with digitonin. Upon illumination the reduction of the primary
acceptor was indicated by absorbance changes due to the reduction of a
plastoquinone to the semiquinone anion and by a small blue shifts of absorption
bands near 545 nm (C550) and 685 nm. The semiquinone to chlorophyll ratio was
between 1/20 and 1/70 in various preparations. The terminal electron donor in
this reaction did not cause large absorbance changes but its oxidized form was
revealed by a hitherto unknown electron spin resonance (ESR) signal, which had
some properties of the well-known signal II but a linewidth and g-value much
nearer to those of signal I. Upon darkening absorbance and ESR changes decayed
together in a cyclic or back reaction which was stimulated by 3-(3,4
dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. The donor could be oxidized by ferricyanide in 
the dark. Illumination in the presence of ferricyanide induced absorbance and ESR
changes, rapidly reversed upon darkening, which may be ascribed to the oxidation 
of a chlorophyll a dimer, possibly the primary electron donor of photosystem II. 
In addition an ESR signal with 15 to 20 gauss linewidth and a slower dark decay
was observed, which may have been caused by a secondary donor.

Enzymic reactions of fatty acid hydroperoxides in extracts of potato tuber. II.
Conversion of 9- and 13-hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acids to monohydroxydienoic
acid, epoxyhydroxy- and trihydroxymonoenoic acid derivatives.

Galliard T, Phillips DR, Matthew JA.

1. Crude extracts and partially purified enzyme preparations from potato tubers
catalyse, at pH 5-7, the conversion of linoleic acid hydroperoxides to a range of
oxygenated fatty acid derivatives. 2. 9-D- and 13-L-hydroperoxide isomers are
converted at similar rates to equivalent (isomeric) products. 3. The major
products from the 13-hydroperoxide isomer were identified as the corresponding
monohydroxydienoic acid derivative,
threo-11-hydroxy-trans12,13-epoxy-octadec-cis9-enoic acid and
9,12,13-trihydroxy-octadec-trans10-enoic acid. The corresponding products from
the 9-hydroperoxide were the monohydroxydienoic acid,
9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-octadec-12-enoic acid and
9,10,13-trihydroxy-octadec-11-enoic acid. 4. No separation of activities forming 
the different products was achieved by partial purification of enzyme extracts.
5. Product formation was unaffected by EDTA, CN-, sulphydryl reagents or
glutathione but was reduced by boiling the extracts. 6. This system is compared
with the 9-hydroperoxide-specific enzymic formation of divinyl ether derivatives 
by potato extracts.

Partial purification and properties of microsomal phosphatidate phosphohydrolase 
from rat liver.

Caras I, Shapiro B.

Microsomal phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (phosphatidate phosphatase EC 3.1.3.4) 
was solubilized and fractionated to yield at least two distinct enzymatically
active fractions. One, denoted FA, was non-specific, had a relatively high Km for
phosphatidic acid and was insensitive to inhibition by diacylglycerol. The second
fraction, FB, was specific for phosphatidates, had a low Km, and was inhibited,
non-competitively, by diacylglycerol. FA exhibited a sigmoid substrate-activity
curve. The isolated FB aggregated to particles of about 10(6) in the absence of
salts and could be dissociated by the addition of monovalent cations at ionic
strength 0.4-0.6 to about 2-10(5) daltons and thereby doubled its activity.
Dissociation was time- and temperature-dependent. F- was inhibitory. Divalent
ions were not required for the activity of FA or FB and inhibited at
concentrations exceeding 1 mM.

Bile acids. XLVII. 12alpha-Hydroxylation of precursors of allo bile acids by
rabbit liver microsomes.

Ali SS, Elliott WH.

Rabbit liver microsomal preparations fortified with 0.1 mM NADPH effectively
promote hydroxylation of [3beta-3H]- or [24-14C]allochenodeoxycholic acid or
[5alpha,6alpha-3H2]5alpha-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha-diol to their respective
12alpha-hydroxyl derivatives in yields of about 25 or 65% in 60 min. Minor
amounts of other products are formed from the diol. The requirements for activity
of rabbit liver microsomal 12alpha-hydroxylase resemble those of rat liver
microsomes. Of a number of enzyme inhibitors studied only p-chloromercuribenzoate
demonstrated a marked ability to inhibit the reaction with either tritiated
substrate. There was no difference in the quantity of product produced from the
tritiated acid or the 14C-labeled acid. No clear sex difference was found in
activity of the enzyme, nor was an appreciable difference noted in activity of
the enzyme between mature and immature animals.

Partial purification and properties of a phenobarbital-induced aldehyde
dehydrogenase of rat liver.

Koivula T, Koivusalo M.

Properties of the phenobarbital induced cytoplasmic aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC
1.2.1.3) have been studied in rat liver. 7-12-Fold higher levels were seen in the
cytoplasmic activities after phenobarbital treatment in reactor compared to
non-reactor animals with high concentrations of acetaldehyde (18 mM) and
propionaldehyde (9 mM). No difference was found with 0.12 mM acetaldehyde, 2 mM
glycolaldehyde, 6 mM formaldehyde or 0.5 mM betaine aldehyde. The reactor group
also had slightly higher activity in the mitochondrial fraction with the high
acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde concentrations. In the microsomal fraction, the 
activities showed no differences at any substrate concentration. An induced
aldehyde dehydrogenase was purified 70-fold by chromatographic techniques. It had
different molecular and enzymic properties than the main high-Km enzyme normally 
present in rat liver cytoplasm. The pI of the induced enzyme was about 7.0 as
measured by isoelectric focusing. It was active with several aliphatic and
aromatic aldehydes but not with formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde or D-glyceraldehyde.
The Km-values for propionaldehyde and acetaldehyde were in the millimolar range. 
Millimolar concentrations of aromatic aldehydes caused a strong substrate
inhibition. The enzyme was inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of
disulfiram. Estrone, deoxycorticosterone, progesterone and diethylstilbestrol
also affected the enzyme activity.

Cholinesterases from plant tissues. VI. Preliminary characterization of enzymes
from Solanum melongena L. and Zea mays L.

Fluck RA, Jaffe MJ.

Enzymes capable of hydrolyzing esters of thiocholine have been assayed in
extracts of Solanum melongena L. (eggplant) and Zea Mays L. (corn). The enzymes
from both species are inhibited by the anti-cholinesterases neostigmine,
physostigmine, and 284c51 and by AMO-1618, a plant growth retardant and they both
have pH optima near pH 8.0. The enzyme from eggplant is maximally active at a
substrate concentration of 0.15 mM acetylthiocholine and is inhibited at higher
substrate concentrations. On the basis of this last property, the magnitude of
inhibition by the various inhibitors, and the substrate specificity, we conclude 
that the enzyme from eggplant, but not that from corn, is a cholinesterase.

Behavior of soluble and immobilized acid phosphatase in hydro-organic media.

Wan H, Horvath C.

The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate by wheat germ acid phosphatase
(orthophosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.2) has been investigated in
mixtures of aqueous buffers with acetone, dioxane and acetonitrile. The enzyme
was either in free solution or immobilized on a pellicular support which
consisted of a porous carbonaceous layer on solid glass beads. The highest enzyme
activity was obtained in acetone and acetonitrile mixed with citrate buffer over 
a wide range of organic solvent concentration. In 50% (v/v) acetone both V and Km
of the immobilized enzyme were about half of the values in the neat aqueous
buffer, but the Ki for inorganic phosphate was unchanged. In 50% (v/v) mixtures
of various solvents and citrate buffers of different pH, the enzymic activity was
found to depend on the pH of the aqueous buffer component rather than the pH of
the hydro-organic mixture as measured with the glass-calomel electrode. The
relatively high rates of p-nitrophenol liberation in the presence of glucose even
at high organic solvent concentrations suggest that transphosphorylation is
facilitated at low water activity.

Purification and some enzymatic properties of the chitosanase from Bacillus R-4
which lyses Rhizopus cell walls.

Tominaga Y, Tsujisaka Y.

A strain of Bacillus sp (Bacillus R-4) produces a protease and a carbohydrolase
both of which have the ability to lyse Rhizopus cell walls. Of the enzymes, the
carbohydrolase has been purified to an ultracentrifugally and electrophoretically
homogeneous state, and identified as a chitosanase. The enzyme was active on
glycol chitosan as well as chitosan. Molecular weight of the purified enzyme was 
estimated as 31 000 and isoelectric point as pH 8.30. The enzyme was most active 
at pH 5.6 and at 40 degrees C with either Rhizopus cell wall or glycol chitosan
as substrate, and was stable over a range of pH 4.5 to 7.5 at 40 degrees C for 3 
h. The activity was lost by sulfhydryl reagents and restored by either reduced
glutathione of L-cysteine. An abrupt decrease in viscosity of the reaction
mixture suggested an endowise cleavage of chitosan by this enzyme.

Specificity studies on alpha-mannosidases using oligosaccharides from
mannosidosis urine as substrates.

Hultberg B, Lundblad A, Masson PK, Ockerman PA.

Oligosaccharides containing terminal non-reducing alpha(1 leads to 2)-, alpha(1
leads to 3)-, and alpha(1 leads to 6)-linked mannose residues, isolated from
human and bovine mannosidosis urines were used as substrates to test the
specificities of acidic alpha-mannosidases isolated from human and bovine liver. 
The enzymes released all the alpha-linked mannose residues from each
oligosaccharide and were most effective on the smallest substrate. Enzyme A in
each case was less active on the oligosaccharides than alpha-mannosidase B2, even
though the apparent Km value for the substrates was the same with each enzyme.
The human acidic alpha-mannosidases were also found to be more active on
substrates isolated from human rather than bovine mannosidosis urine. Human
alpha-mannosidase C, which has a neutral pH optimum when assayed with a synthetic
substrate, did not hydrolyse any of the oligosaccharides at neutral pH, but was
found to be active at an acidic pH.

Calcium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase in the microsomal fraction of tooth
germ from porcine fetus.

Yoshimura F, Suzuki T.

The characterization and localization of a Ca(2+)-ATPase (ATP phosphohydrolase,
EC 3.6.1.3) in the tooth germ of the porcine fetus are reported. This enzyme, a
microsome fraction, is preferentially activated by Ca(2+). In the presence of 0.5
mM ATP, maximal enzyme activity is obtained at 0.5--1.0 mM CaCl2. The maximal
rate of ATP hydrolysis is approx. 20 mumol per h per mg of protein as the enzyme 
preparation is used here. At optimal Ca(2+) concentration, the Mg(2+) has an
inhibitory effect. The enzyme does not require Na+ or/and K+ for activation by
Ca(2+). Other nucleotide triphosphates may serve as the substrate, but V for ATP 
is the highest. The Km for ATP is 8.85 - 10(-5) M. The optimal pH for Ca(2+)
activation of the enzyme lies around 9.2. Well known inhibitors of (Na+ +
K+)-ATPase, mitochondria ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase in the erthrocyte do not
inhibit the enzyme. In the subcellular order the enzyme may be assumed to be
localized in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum fraction containing cell and Golgi 
body membrane fragments and in the tissue order in the enamel organ containing an
ameloblast layer, stratum intermedium and stellate reticulum.

Preparation and characterization of an enzymatically active immobilized
derivative of myosin.

Elgart ES, Gusovsky T, Rosenberg MD.

Purified skeletal muscle myosin (EC 3.6.1.3) has been covalently bound to
Sepharose 4B by the cyanogen bromide procedure. The resulting complex,
Sepharose-Myosin, possesses adenosine triphosphatase activity and is relatively
stable for long periods of time. Under optimal binding conditions, approximately 
33% of the specific ATPase activity of the bound myosin is retained.
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of polypeptides released from denatured
Sepharose-Myosin indicates that 85% of the myosin is attached to the agarose
beads through the heavy chains and the remainder through the light chains, in
agreement with predictions of binding and release based upon either the lysine
contents or molecular weights of themyosin subunits. The adenosine triphosphatase
of the immobilized myosin has been investigated under conditions of varying pH,
ionic strength, and cation concentration. The ATPase profiles of immobilized
myosin are quite similar to those for free myosin, however subtle differences are
found. The Sepharose-Myosin ATPase is not as sensitive as myosin to alterations
in salt concentration and the apparent KM is approximately two-fold higher than
that of myosin. These differences are probably due to chemical modification in
the region of the attachment site(s) to the agarose beads and hydration and
diffusion limitations imposed by the polymeric agarose matrix.

Radioactive labeling and location of specific thiol groups in myosin from fast,
slow and cardiac muscles.

Pfister M, Schaub MC, Watterson JG, Knecht M, Waser PG.

1. Based on incorporation of radioactively labeled N-ethylmaleimide, the readily 
reactive thiol groups of isolated myosin (EC 3.6.1.3) from fast, slow and cardiac
muscles could be classified into 3 types. All 3 myosins contain 2 thiol-1, 2
thiol-2 and a variable number of thiol-3 groups per molecule. Both thiol-1 and
thiol-2 groups which are essential for functioning of the K+-stimulated ATPase,
are located in the heavy chains in all 3 myosin types. 2. The variation in the
incorporation pattern of N-ethylmaleimide over the 3 thiol group classes under
steady-state conditions of Mg(2+) - ATP hydrolysis allowed different
conformations of some reaction intermediates to be characterized. In all 3 types 
of myosin the hydrolytic cycle of Mg(2+) - ATP was found to be controlled by the 
same step at 25 degrees C. In all three cases, this rate-limiting step is changed
in the same way by lowereing temperature. 3. Using the chemically determined
molecular weights for myosin light chains, their stoichiometry was found on the
basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis to be 1.2 : 2.1 : 0.8 for light
chain-1: light chain-2:light chain-3 per molecule of fast myosin, 2.0 : 1.9 for
light chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of slow myosin and 1.9 : 1.9 for light
chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of cardiac myosin. This qualitative difference
in light subunit composition between the fast and the two types of slow myosin is
not reflected in the small variations of the characteristics exhibited by the
isolated myosins, but rather seems to be connected with their respective
myofibrillar ATPase activities.

Yeast glutathione reductase. Studies of the kinetics and stability of the enzyme 
as a function of pH and salt concentration.

Moroff G, Brandt KG.

1. The pH dependencies of the apparent Michaelis constant for oxidized
glutathione and the apparent turnover number of yeast glutathione reductase (EC
1.6.4.2) have been determined at a fixed concentration of 0.1 mM NADPH in the
range pH 4.5--8.0. Between pH 5.5 and 7.6, both of these parameters are
relatively constant. The principal effect of low pH on the kinetics of the
enzyme-catalyzed reaction is the observation of a pH-dependent substrate
inhibition by oxidized glutathione at pH less than or equal 7, which is shown to 
correlate with the binding of oxidized glutathione to the oxidized form of the
enzyme. 2. The catalytic activity of yeast glutathione reductase at pH 5.5 is
affected by the sodium acetate buffer concentration. The stability of the
oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme at pH 5.5 and 25 degrees C in the
absence of bovine serum albumin was studied as a function of sodium acetate
concentration. The results show that activation of the catalytic activity of the 
enzyme at low sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium
acetate on a reduced form of the enzyme. In contrast, inhibition of the catalytic
activity of the enzyme at high sodium acetate concentration correlates with an
effect of sodium acetate on the oxidized form of the enzyme.

Characteristics of the dephosphorylated form of phosphorylase purified from rat
liver and measurement of its activity in crude liver preparations.

Tan AW, Nuttall FQ.

The phosphorylated form of liver glycogen phosphorylase (alpha-1,4-glucan :
orthophosphate alpha-glucosyl-transferase, EC 2.4.1.1) (phosphorylase a) is
active and easily measured while the dephosphorylated form (phosphorylase b), in 
contrast to the muscle enzyme, has been reported to be essentially inactive even 
in the presence of AMP. We have purified both forms of phosphorylase from rat
liver and studied the characteristics of each. Phosphorylase b activity can be
measured with our assay conditions. The phosphorylase b we obtained was
stimulated by high concentrations of sulfate, and was a substrate for muscle
phosphorylase kinase whereas phosphorylase a was inhibited by sulfate, and was a 
substrate for liver phosphorylase phosphatase. Substrate binding to phosphorylase
b was poor (KM glycogen = 2.5 mM, glucose-1-P = 250 mM) compared to phosphorylase
a (KM glycogen = 1.8 mM, KM glucose-1-P = 0.7 mM). Liver phosphorylase b was
active in the absence of AMP. However, AMP lowered the KM for glucose-1-P to 80
mM for purified phosphorylase b and to 60 mM for the enzyme in crude extract (Ka 
= 0.5 mM). Using appropriate substrate, buffer and AMP concentrations, assay
conditions have been developed which allow determination of phosphorylase a and
90% of the phosphorylase b activity in liver extracts. Interconversion of the two
forms can be demonstrated in vivo (under acute stimulation) and in vitro with
little change in total activity. A decrease in total phosphorylase activity has
been observed after prolonged starvation and in diabetes.

Multiple forms of casein kinase from rabbit erythrocytes.

Kumar R, Tao M.

Two rabbit erythrocyte casein kinases, GTP:casein kinase I and GTP:casein kinase 
II, have been purified 29 000- and 47 000-fold, respectively. Studies employing
sucrose density gradient centrifugation indicate that kinase I has a molecular
weight of about 9.5 - 10(5) (25 S) and kinase II about 1.4 - 10(6) (32 S). These 
enzymes can utilize either ATP or GTP as the phosphoryl donor. Among various
protein substrates examined, these kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of casein
greater than 50% dephosphorylated phosvitin congruent to 50% dephosphorylated
casein greater than phosvitin. Histones, protamine and bovine serum albumin are
poor phosphoryl acceptors. Kinetic data indicate that both enzymes are inhibited 
by high casein substrate concentrations which may be partially relieved by NaCl. 
Both phosphotransferases require Mg(2+) for activity and are optimally active at 
pH 9.0. The enzymes have apparent Km values of 2.5 - 10(-5) M for GTP, 2 - 10(-5)
M for ATP, and 0.4--0.6 mg/ml for casein. The incorporation of the terminal
phosphate of GTP into casein as catalyzed by these enzymes is inhibited to
varying degrees by ATP, ITP, ADP, and GDP but not by UTP, CTP, GMP, adenosine
3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, and guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. In
addition, NaF and 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid are also found to inhibit the
activity of both kinases. The effect of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is interesting and
suggests that this metabolite may regulate the activity of the casein kinases in 
the red blood cells.

Kinetic studies and effects of anions on creatine phosphokinase from skeletal
muscle of rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta).

Chegwidden WR, Watts DC.

A purification procedure for creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) from muscle of the
monke35--170 muequiv H+/mg protein per min at 30 degrees C and a yield of approx.
0.5 g/kg muscle. Assuming equilibrium kinetics, synergistic binding of substrates
at one catalytic site is found for both the forward and back reactions. Kinetic
constants for the binding of each substrate to the free enzyme and the
enzyme-second substrate complex are determined and are compared with those for
the enzyme from other species. Inhibition by small anions is determined in the
presence of different combinations of substrates and products. SO4(2-) inhibits
by simple competitive inhibition and probably binds at the site of the
transferrable phosphoryl group. Inhibition by NO3-, NO2-, SCN- and Cl- is more
complex and these ions are suggested to mimic the transferrable phosphoryl group 
in a planar transition-state complex. These anions stabilize the dead-end
complex, enzyme-creatine-MgADP, which lacks the transferable phosphoryl group.
The effects of these anions on the dissociation constants of the enzyme-substrate
complexes is reported and is in accord with the above hypothesis. The dead-end
complex in the absence of anion does not protect the essential thiol group
against inhibition by iodoacetamide. Addition of NO3- or Cl- to the dead-end
complex or a substrate equilibrium mixture without anion confers protection. The 
essential thiol group is inhibited by iodoacetamide at a rate which is
essentially independent of pH over the normal stability range of the enzyme.
Contrary to our previous report this pH independence is not altered by the
presence of dead-end complex, creatine plus MgADP, in the presence or absence of 
anion or in the presence of a substrate equilibrium mixture. It is inferred that 
the 'essential' thiol group of the monkey enzyme has essentially the same
properties as that of the rabbit enzyme. In consequence, the inferences made
about the role of this group based on our previous work on the monkey enzyme are 
no longer valid. The present findings are compatible with the essential thiol
group playing a conformational role in the catalytic process.

Studies on rat renal cortical cell kallikrein. I. Separation and measurement.

Kaizu T, Margolius HS.

A technique has been developed to separate and measure kallikrein in a
heterogeneous population of rat renal cortical cells in suspension. After rat
kidneys were perfused in situ in anaesthetized rats, viable, counted cortical
cell suspensions were obtained. Cells were suspended in a sucrose/Tris buffer
containing 0.5% deoxycholate, homogenized, centrifuged, dialyzed, and gel
filtered on Sephadex G-25. Column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose resulted in a 
single peak of esterase activity between 0.20 to 0.25 M NaCl/sodium phosphate
buffer. Subsequent elution yielded an alkaline esterase which was identical to
kallikrein isolated from rat urine, insofar as pH optimum, effects of inhibitors,
bioassay activity and immunological properties were concerned. Calculated yields 
were about 70% of the total esterase activity present in the parent cell
homogenates. Recoveries of a purified rat urinary kallikrein added to the cell
homogenates, the DEAE-cellulose columns, or the eluates from the columns ranged
from 83-108% (mean 96%). Using this technique, it was found that the amount of
kallikrein activity present in non-incubated renal cortical cells ranged from
0.6-10(-2) to 4.6 - 10(-2) alpha-N-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (Tos-Arg-OMe)
esterase units per 10(8) cells. However, cells incubated in a nutrient medium at 
37 degrees C for 3-8 h contained no measurable kallikrein activity, whereas the
surrounding medium had kallikrein activity which could be significantly increased
by aldosterone and decreased by spironolactone.

Studies on electron transfer between mercury electrode and hemoprotein.

Scheller F, Jänchen M, Lampe J, Prümke HJ, Blanck J, Palecek E.

The electrochemical behaviour of ferricytochrome c, metmyoglobin and
methemoglobin was studied using d.c., a.c. and differential pulse polarography,
and controlled potential electrolysis. 1. The three hemoproteins yield d.c.
polarographic steps, and peaks in differential pulse polarograms, the height of
which is proportional to concentration. The charge transfer is influenced by
strong adsorption. 2. The concentration dependence of the a.c. polarograms
indicates structural changes in the adsorbed molecules. 3. The reduction products
of controlled potential electrolysis of metmyoglobin and methemoglobin have
absorption spectra identical with the native control samples. The affinity for
oxygen and the cooperativity in hemoglobin are not affected by the reaction at
the electrode. 4. The charge transfer proceeds via adsorbed, already reduced,
molecules to freely diffusible proteins.

The binding of organic phosphates to human methaemoglobin A. Perturbation of the 
polymerization of proteins by effectors.

Baghurst PA, Nichol LW.

Theory is presented relating to the binding of an effector to two states of a
protein acceptor coexisting in equilibrium. The problem is treated in terms of
the four possible cases which specify relations between numbers of binding sites 
and intrinsic binding constants relevant to the acceptor states. It is shown that
a distinction between these cases may be possible on the basis of the form of a
plot of unbound effector concentration versus the constituent equilibrium
coefficient which may be calculated from the sedimentation coefficient of the
protein constituent. Particularly noteworthy in this respect is the finding that 
a turning point may exist in this plot for defined conditions with systems in
which binding sites are not conserved (and binding affinities are altered) on
polymer formation. The latter type of system is exemplified by studies on
methaemoglobin A in 0.25 M sodium acetate, pH 5.4. In the absence of added
organic phosphate effectors, a dimer-tetramer equilibrium operates governed by an
association constant of 4.15 +/- 0.06 X 10(3) 1/mol, determined from
sedimentation equilibrium results. Correlation of sedimentation velocity and
equilibrium results shows that addition of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)
results in its binding to one site on each of the dimeric (alpha beta) and
tetrameric (alpha beta)2 species with intrinsic binding constants
1.03-10(3)-1.20-10(3) and 1.1-10(4)-2.1-10(4) 1/mol, respectively. It is also
shown that 2,3-diphosphoglycerate perturbs the dimer-tetramer equilibrium in a
similar way to ATP.

N-terminal spin label studies of hemoglobin, Ligand and pH dependence.

Giangrande M, Kim YW, Mizukami H.

Human hemoglobin was spin labeled with
4-isothiocanato-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperdinooxyl, which is known to bind
specifically to the N-terminal alpha-amino groups of proteins and slightly to the
reactive sulfhydryl groups. Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis indicated a
partially resolved five-line spectrum, suggesting that the label was attached to 
at least two different binding sites. Using specific blocking reagents prior to
spin labeling, the two binding sites were attributed to the sulfhydryl group of
beta-93 (immobile) and the alpha-amino group of the N-terminal valines (mobile). 
The relative motion of the spin at one set of binding sites was restricted
regardless of the state of ligation and pH, while the motion at the other site
showed dependence on those parameters, e.g. the spin-labeled N-terminal ends of
deoxyhemoglobin have restricted motion at all pH ranges studied, while those of
oxyhemoglobin are relatively free to move at the basic pH range, but become more 
restricted in the acidic pH range.

The behavior of holo- and apo-forms of bovine superoxide dismutase at low pH.

Fee JA, Phillips WD.

1. Holo-superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes has been shown to undergo a
reversible structural modification in the pH 3-5 range. 2. The spectral
alterations observed on changing from neutrality to pH 2 were: a slight
attenuation of the 680 nm absorbance; the loss of the 450 nm shoulder, apparent
in the optical spectrum of the native protein; and a new band appeared at 330 nm.
The circular dichroism at 600 nm was essentially lost while a weak negative band 
appeared at approx. 380 nm and a positive band at 310 nm. 3. The EPR spectrum was
also modified on changing from the native to the low pH form: A parallel
increased from approximately 130 to approximately 150 G, g parallel remained
unchanged at approximately 2.27, and gm decreased from approximately 2.09 to
approximately 2.08. The apparent linewidth remained essentially constant. 4. High
resolution (220 MHz) PMR spectra of holo- and apoproteins revealed that the
metals influence the three-dimensional structure of the protein. 5. PMR studies
indicated that at pH 3 the apoprotein existed almost entirely in a random coil
form and that it assumed a compact well-ordered structure on returning to neutral
pH. The holoprotein maintained a compact, apparently dimeric, structure even at
pH 3.

Mechanical precipitation of hemoglobin köln.

Asakura T, Adachi K, Shapiro M, Friedman S, Schwartz E.

Hb Köln (beta 98 Val leads to Met) was found to precipitate rapidly during
mechanical shaking. The rate of precipitation of Hb Köln is 5-6 times faster than
that of Hb S. The kinetics of precipitation of the patient's hemolysate, which is
a mixture of Hb Köln and Hb A, showed a biphasic curve indicating that Hb Köln
precipitates independently from Hb A. The instability of Hb Köln may be
attributed to the conformational change in the vicinity of heme. The mechanical
shaking may be used as a new method for detection and quantitation of hemoglobin 
Köln and other unstable hemoglobins.

Physical properties and subunits of Haemopis grandis erythrocruorin.

Andonian MR, Barrett AS, Vinogradov SN.

The erythrocruorin of the leech Haemopis grandis possessed an S20,w of 57 S at
neutral pH, its isoelectric point at pH 6.0 and exhibited a slightly sigmoid
oxygenation curve with n approximately 2.1 and P50 = 11.2 mm at pH 7.4. A minimum
molecular weight of 24000 +/- 1500 per heme group was determined from the iron
and heme contents, 0.22 +/- 0.01 and 2.73 +/- 0.14 weight %, respectively. The
subunit composition of the erythrocruorin was investigated using gel filtration
in sodium dodecyl sulfate and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium
dodecyl sulfate at neutral pH. Haemopis erythrocruorin dissociated in the
presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate into four subunits (1 through 4) possessing
molecular weights of about 27000, 23000, 21000 and 13500, respectively. When the 
erythrocruorin was reduced with mercaptoethanol prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate
electrophoresis, three subunits were observed, possessing molecular weights of
about 13000 (I), 16500 (II) and 28000 (III). Sodium dodecyl sulfate
electrophoresis of the isolated subunits 1 through 4 showed that subunit I was
provided by subunits 1 and 4, subunit II was provided by subunit 1 and subunit
III was provided by both subunit 2 and subunit 3. Haemopis erythrocruorin thus
appeared to consist of at least five different polypeptide chains. It is likely
that not all of the constituent polypeptide chains were associated each with a
heme group. The shape of the Haemopis erythrocruorin observed by electron
microscopy appeared to be consistent with the two-tiered hexagonal array
characteristic of annelid erythrocruorins and chlorocruorins.

Myosin from arterial smooth muscle: isolation following actin depolymerization.

Megerman J, Murphy RA.

The contractile proteins from arterial smooth muscle are highly soluble, and can 
be extracted at I = 0.05. However, they can be precipitated by a prolonged
dialysis at pH 6 to give an actomyosin with a high, although variable,
actin:myosin ratio. The sedimentation behavior of this actomyosin at high ionic
strength was examined as a function of pH, protein concentration and composition 
by preparative ultracentrifugation. Comparisons with synthetic skeletal muscle
actomyosins of similar composition demonstrated significant differences in the
behaviors of these two systems. It was found that much smooth muscle actomyosin
is not dissociated by normally relaxing conditions, and that it sediments at a
slower rate than F-actin. The solubility of the supernatant protein (a
myosin-enriched actomyosin) in 0.2 M K Cl (pH 7) depended on the pH during
centrifugation. A lower solubility was associated only with a higher actin
concentration in the supernatant, suggesting a dependence on actin
repolymerization. Pure myosin was selectively precipitated from the supernatant
by polyethylene glycol-6000, but only when the protein was soluble at low ionic
strength. The solubility of purified myosin was similar to that of myosin from
striated muscles. A relationship between the presence of depolymerized actin and 
the high solubility of smooth muscle contractile proteins is suggested.

Hybrids of chemical derivatives of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase.

Meighen E, Yue R.

The activities of hybrid dimers of alkaline phosphatase containing two chemically
modified subunits have been investigated. One hybrid species was prepared by
dissociation and reconstitution of a mixture of two variants produced by chemical
modification of the native enzyme with succinic anhydride and tetranitromethane, 
respectively. The succinyl-nitrotyrosyl hybrid was separated from the other
members of the hybrid set by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography and then converted to a
succinyl-aminotyrosyl hybrid by reduction of the modified tyrosine residues with 
sodium dithionite. A comparison of the activities of these two hybrids with the
activities of the succinyl, nitrotyrosyl and aminotyrosyl derivatives has shown
that either the subunits of alkaline phosphatase function independently or if the
subunits turnover alternately in a reciprocating mechanism, then the intrinsic
activity of each subunit must be strongly dependent on its partner subunit.

Some physicochemical properties of hemoglobin-manitoba (alpha2 102Ser replaced by
Arg (G9) beta2).

Wrightstone RN, Smith LL, Wilson JB, Vella F, Huisman TH.

Hb-Manitoba was discovered in 1970 [1] in a Canadian family of British origin.
Recently we observed the same variant in a second family, and found that the
oxy-derivative of Hb-Manitoba is slightly unstable at 65 degrees C, dissociates
less readily at alkaline pH than does Hb-A, and forms asymmetric hybrids with
other hemoglobins which are readily detectable by electrophoresis.

The oxygen affinity of haemoglobin Tak, a variant with an elongated beta chain.

Imai K, Lehmann H.

The oxygen affinity was investigated of purified Hb Tak, a human haemoglobin
variant with elongated beta-chains. A very low P50 value was found which was not 
influenced by the addition of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate. The n value was 1,
indicating non-cooperativity. The oxygen equilibrium curve of the whole blood
haemolysate containing Hbs A and Tak was close to that of Hb A at the top of the 
curve, while the bottom of the curve greatly deviated from the latter, indicative
of small if any interaction between Hb A and Tak during oxygenation.

Effects of membrane ribonuclease and 3'-nucleotidase on the digestion of
polyuridylic acid by rat liver plasma membrane.

Aronson NN Jr, Yannarell A.

1. Fragments of isolated rat liver plasma membrane possess a ribonuclease
activity which at pH 7.8 in the presence of 10 mM EDTA can digest polyuridylic
acid (poly(U)) and polycytidylic acid (poly(C)) but not polyadenylic acid
(poly(A)) and polyguanylic acid (poly(G)). Under these conditions, the membrane
preparation does not degrade native or denatured DNA. 2. The products of the
reaction with poly(U) (10 mM EDTA present) can be separated on DEAE-Sephadex into
oligonucleotides of increasing chain length. Most of the products are di- to
hexa-nucleotides which contain terminal 3'-phosphate groups. 3. When EDTA is not 
present (pH 7.8 or 8.8) the plasma membrane preparation degrades both poly(A) and
poly(U). With poly(A) the product is all nucleoside while with poly(U) as
substrate most of the product is nucleoside, but also some oligonucleotides are
produced. 4. The ribonuclease releases acid soluble products very slowly from
high concentrations of poly(U) (mg/ml). 5. Uridine trinucleotide with and without
a terminal 3'-phosphate group is degraded by rat liver plasma membrane. The
trinucleotide diphosphate is rapidly hydrolyzed to nucleoside while the
trinucleotide itself is slowly digested and yields intermediate products,
including nucleoside.

Alterations in phospholipid-dependent (Na+ +K+)-ATPase activity due to lipid
fluidity. Effects of cholesterol and Mg2+.

Kimelberg HK.

The (Na+ +K+)-activated, Mg2+-dependent ATPase from rabbit kidney outer medulla
was prepared in a partially inactivated, soluble form depleted of endogenous
phospholipids, using deoxycholate. This preparation was reactivated 10 to 50-fold
by sonicated liposomes of phosphatidylserine, but not by non-sonicated
phosphatidylserine liposomes or sonicated phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The
reconstituted enzyme resembled native membrane preparations of (Na+ +K+)-ATPase
in its pH optimum being around 7.0, showing optimal activity at Mg2+:ATP mol
ratios of approximately 1 and a Km value for ATP of 0.4 mM. Arrhenius plots of
this reactivated activity at a constant pH of 7.0 and an Mg2+: ATP mol ratio of
1:1 showed a discontinuity (sharp change of slope) at 17 degrees C, with
activation energy (Ea) values of 13-15 kcal/mol above this temperature and 30-35 
kcal below it. A further discontinuity was also found at 8.0 degrees C and the Ea
below this was very high (greater than 100 kcal/mol). Increased Mg2+
concentrations at Mg2+:ATP ratios in excess of 1:1 inhibited the (Na+ +K+)-ATPase
activity and also abolished the discontinuities in the Arrhenius plots. The
addition of cholesterol to phosphatidylserine at a 1:1 mol ratio partially
inhibited (Na+ +K+)-ATPase reactivation. Arrhenius plots under these conditions
showed a single discontinuity at 20 degrees C and Ea values of 22 and 68 kcal/mol
above and below this temperature respectively. The ouabain-insensitive
Mg2+-ATPase normally showed a linear Arrhenius plot with an Ea of 8 kcal/mol. The
cholesterol-phosphatidylserine mixed liposomes stimulated the Mg2+-ATPase
activity, which now also showed a discontinuity at 20 degrees C with, however, an
increased value of 14 kcal/mol above this temperature and 6 kcal/mol below.
Kinetic studies showed that cholesterol had no significant effect on the Km
values for ATP. Since both cholesterol and Mg2+ are known to alter the effects of
temperature on the fluidity of phospholipids, the above results are discussed in 
this context.

Conformational and molecular responses to pH variation of the purified membrane
adenosine triphosphatase of Micrococcus lysodeikticus.

Nieto M, Muñoz E, Carreira J, Andreu JM.

A preparation of ATPase from the membranes of Micrococcus lysodeikticus,
solubilized and more than 95% pure, showed two main bands in analytical
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They did not correspond to isoenzymes because
one band could be converted into the other by exposure to a mildly alkaline pH
value. The conversion was paralleled by changes in molecular weight, circular
dichroism and catalytic properties. Denaturation by pH at 25 degrees C was
followed by means of circular dichroism, ultracentrifugation and polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis. A large conformational transition took place in the acid
range with midpoints at about pH = 3.6 (I = 10(-4) M), 4.3 (I = 0.03 M) and 5.3
(I = 0.1 M). The transition was irreversible. Strong aggregation of the protein
occurred in this range of pH. The final product was largely random coil, but even
at pH 1.5 dissociation into individual subunits was not complete. However,
partial dissociation took place at pH 5 (I = 0.028 M). At this pH value the
enzyme was inactive, but 20-30% of the activity could be recovered when the pH
was returned to 7.5. In the alkaline region the midpoint of the transition
occurred near pH = 11 (I = 0.028 M). The pK of most of the tyrosine residues of
the protein was about 10.9. The unfolding was irreversible and the protein was
soon converted into peptide species with molecular weights lower than those
determined for the subunits by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium
dodecyl sulphate. Conventional proteolysis did not account for the
transformation.

Membrane-bound enzymes. III. Protease activity in leucocytes in relation to
erythrocyte membranes.

Heller M, Edelstein P, Mayer M.

Protease activity was detected in membranes of human bovine erythrocytes prepared
by the conventional procedures which include washing and removal of the "buffy
layer". The enzyme was extracted by 0.75 M KCNS or (NH4)2SO4 and was activated by
0.4 to 0.5 M of the same salts. Colored, particulate hide powder-azure, membrane 
fractions and soluble proteins such as hemoglobin, casein or albumin were
susceptible to hydrolysis by the membraneous protease. Partial purification of
the enzyme was accomplished through disc-gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide in
the presence of 0.25% positively charged detergents like cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide. An alkaline protease (pH 7.4) with properties similar to those of the
erythrocyte enzyme was found in leucocytes. The similarity between the properties
of the leucocytic and erythrocytic proteases and the correlation of the activity 
in erythrocyte membranes with content of white cells in these preparations,
suggest that enzymatic activities in the contaminating leucocytes are responsible
for the activity of membraneous proteases in erythrocytes.

[Structure formation in interphase adsorption layers of lysozyme at liquid

[Article in Russian]

Alekseeva IG, Lapina GP, Tulovskaia ZD, Izmaĭlova VN.

In connection with the modelling of biomembranes regularities of the formation
and development of interphase adsorption layers of lysozyme at liquid borders
under different conditions and depending on the nature of carbohydrate phase were
investigated by the determination of mechanical characteristics of such layers.
The investigations carried out showed that the most solid layers appeared under
the conditions which assured the formation of the maximum number of
intermolecular bonds (which in a common case is performed with maximum
disorderlinesss of the macromolecules which get at the interphase).

[Relation between fluorescence and circular dichroism of the complex of the
fluorescence probe 4-dimethylaminochalcone with serum albumin].

[Article in Russian]

Dobretsov GE, Kharitonenkov IG, Mishiev VE, Vladimirov IuA.

The fluorescence probe(4-dimethylaminochalcone; DMH) was noncovalently linked to 
human serum albumin (HSA). The variation of pH was due to serum albumin
structural changes, which was determined in terms of DMH and HSA fluorescence and
CD spectra. Considerable changes of fluorescence and CD spectra were observed at 
pH 8 and 10, where there is ionization of two more recently titrated tyrosin
residues. It is assumed that these two tyrosine residues are in binding region
and quench the fluorescence of DMH between pH 4 to 8. Quenching disappears if
these residues are ionized (pH greater than 8) or if the protein undergoes the N 
-F transition (pH less than 4).

[Luminescence study of the effect of temperature on the conformational state of

[Article in Russian]

Konev SV, Katibnikov MA, Bandarin VA, Niamaa D, Barkovskiĭ EV.

Comment in
    Hepatology. 2011 May;53(5):1776; author reply 1777.

Results are presented of measuring fibrinogen fluorescence parameters in
temperature range of 20-80 degrees C at different pH of the solution. It was
found that the temperature increase from 20 to 40 degrees C for solutions with pH
of 4,5-9,3 were not accompanied by the conformational changes of fibrinogen
macromolecules. In the temperature range of 40-50 degrees C for neutral solutions
conformational reconstruction of fibrinogen of undenatured character took place. 
Temperature increase above 50-55 degrees C brings about significant structural
changes of fibrinogen molecule which are of denaturation nature.

Polymer concentration dependence of the helix to random coil transition of a
charged polypeptide in aqueous salt solution.

Nitta K, Yoneyama M.

The helix to coil transition of poly(L-glutamic acid) was investigated in 0.05
and 0.005 M aqueous potassium chloride solutions by use of potentiometric
titration and circular dichroism measurement. Polymer concentration dependence of
the transition was observed in the range from 0.006 to 0.04 monomol/e in 0.005 M 
KG1 solution. The polymer concentration dependence can be interpreted by current 
theories of the transition of charged polypeptides and of titration curves of
linear weak polyelectrolytes taking the effect of polymer concentration into
consideration.

[Combined effects of hypoxia and hypercapnia on the functional state of the
respiratory center].

[Article in Russian]

Kulik AM, Kondrat'eva LN.

Experiments were conducted on cats under nembutal anesthesia; a study was made of
pulse activity of bulbar respiratory neurons, electrical activity of the
diaphragm and of the intercostal muscles; pO2, pCO2, pH, arterial blood oxygen
saturation were determined in combined action of hypoxia and hypercapnia. When
hypoxic gaseous mixture was given for respiration the developing hypocapnia
disturbed the discharge rhythmic activity of the respiratory neurons, the
respiration acquiring a pathological character of the Cheyne--Stokes type. After 
addition to the hypoxic gaseous mixture of 2% CO2 the gaseous composition of the 
arterial blood approached the initial values; this addition prevented the
development of hypercapnia and disturbances of rhythmic discharge activity of the
respiratory neurons. Addition of 5% CO2 to the hypoxic gaseous mixture produced a
negative effect: at first it intensified and then depressed the pulse activity of
the respiratory neurons, caused metabolic and respiratory acidosis, and promoted 
asphyxia.

disturbance of the morphological structure of the liver and of the myocardium,
increase in the activity of alanine and aspargic aminotranspherases in the blood 
serum, dichloroethane reduced the content of nicotinamide coenzymes and deranged

[Effect of carbidine on conditioned defense reflexes].

[Article in Russian]

Barkov NK, Ostrovskaia RU.

Chronic experiments were conducted on rats and rabbits; a study was made of the
effect of carbidine on the conditioned defence reflexes in stimulation of the
mesencephalic part of the reticular formation. Carbidine prevented the depression
of the conditioned defence reflexes caused by stimulation of the mesencephalic
portion of the reticular formation. This pointed to its depressive influence on
the mentioned structures, and was confirmed by experiments on rabbits in
recording changes in biocurrents under conditions of stimulation of the
mesencephalic reticular formation.

[Level of nicotinamide coenzymes in the myocardium of rats during the effects of 
methylxanthines (theophylline, theobromine, caffeine) and catecholamines].

[Article in Russian]

Frantsuzova SB.

It was shown in acute experiments on rats that one hour after an intraperitoneal 
injection of theophylline (50 mg/kg) there was a decrease in the NAD + NADP
content by 19.4%, a tendency to a fall of NAD.H2 + NADP.H2 was expressed, and the
total nicotinamide coferment level was reduced. A tendency to decrease NAD + NADP
and the total pyridine nucleotide level was seen after caffeine administration.
The action of catecholamines and methylxanthines was compared. Theobromine
produced no significant effect on the indices under study. It was shown that
isadrine decreased the NAD + NADP level; adrenaline (25 mkg/kg) increased the
content of both the oxidized (by 24%) and of the reduced (by 48%) forms of
pyridine nucleotides. An increase of adrenaline dose to 1000 mkg/kg was
accompanied by reduction of the oxidized forms (by 22.2%) and of the total
nicotinamide coferment level (by 18%).

Potable water quality in rural Georgetown County.

Sandhu SS, Nelson P, Warren WJ.

Drinking water supplies of 161 rural communities, in Georgetown County, South
Carolina, were randomly selected for sample collection. The analysis showed that 
most of the waters were slightly acidic. Low, but acceptable concentrations of
chloride, copper, fluoride, sodium, cadmium, nitrate and phosphate were found. A 
few water samples showed higher then recommended levels of arsenic, mercury, zinc
and lead. Although only 2% of the samples exceeded the mandatory limit of 0.05
ppm for arsenic, 72% exceeded the recommended level of 0.01 ppm. The mandatory
limit for manganese was exceeded in 37% of the waters while 88% exceeded the
limit for iron. The high iron content was generally responsible for the high
turbidity found in 45% of the samples. The well depth and the consumer income had
some bearing on water quality. Statistical evidence suggested that septic tank
seepage was partially responsible for nitrate, phosphate, iron and arsenic
contamination of shallow water supplies. Lead concentrations appear to vary
according to the plumbing used and the pH of the waters.

The importance of an innervated and intact antrum and pylorus in preventing
postoperative duodenogastric reflux and gastritis.

Keighley MR, Asquith P, Edwards JA, Alexander-Williams J.

This study has investigated the relationship between duodenogastric reflux,
gastritis and certain symptoms 6-12 months after three operations for
uncomplicated duodenal ulcer. The operations studied were proximal gastric
vagotomy (PGV, 20 cases), truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty (TV+P, 22 cases) and 
truncal vagotomy and antrectomy (TV+A, 21 cases). Duodenogastric reflux was
assessed both by a radiological technique and by measuring the concentration of
bilirubin in the gastric aspirate before and after operation. Incidence and
severity of postoperative gastritis were determined by endoscopic biopsy.
Symptoms were assessed by symptomatic score and Visick grading. There was a
significant correlation between duodenal reflux and histological evidence of both
severe superficial gastritis and glandular atrophy (P less than 0-01). There was 
also a close association between the degree of reflux and the presence of severe 
heartburn, epigastric pain and bile vomiting after operation. The amount of
reflux did not differ before operation. There was significantly less reflux
following PGV than after either TV+P (P less than 0-025) or TV+A (P less than
0-001). The results indicate that an operation which preserves an innervated and 
intact antrum and pylorus will protect against postoperative duodenogastric
reflux, gastritis and symptoms.

Haemoglobin Rahere (beta Lys-Thr): A new high affinity haemoglobin associated
with decreased 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate binding and relative polycythaemia.

Lorkin PA, Stephens AD, Beard ME, Wrigley PF, Adams L, Lehmann H.

A new haemoglobin with increased oxygen affinity, beta82 (EF6) lysine leads to
threonine (Hb Rahere), was found during the investigation of a patient who was
found to have a raised haemoglobin concentration after a routine blood count. The
substitution affects one of the 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate binding sites, resulting 
in an increased affinity for oxygen, but both the haem-haem interaction and the
alkaline Bohr effect are normal in the haemolysate. This variant had the same
mobility as haemoglobin A on electrophoresis at alkaline pH but was detected by
measuring the whole blood oxygen affinity; it could be separated from haemoglobin
A, however, by electrophoresis in agar at acid pH. The raised haemoglobin
concentration was mainly due to a reduction in plasma volume (a relative
polycythaemia) and was associated with a persistently raised white blood count.
This case emphasises the need to measure the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin in
all patients with absolute or relative polycythaemia when some obvious cause is
not evident.

Endoscopic papillotomy and removal of gall stones.

Classen M, Safrany L.

Endoscopic papillotomy was attempted in 59 patients with extrahepatic obstruction
of the biliary duct system and was actually performed in 50 patients. A special
high-frequency diathermy knife was introduced via a duodenoscope into the
terminal common bile duct and the roof of the papilla was incised. In 33 out of
39 patients with choledocholithiasis the stones passed into the duodenum
spontaneously or were removed endoscopically. Papillary stenosis without ductal
stones was successfully treated with this method in eight out of 11 patients. One
perforation of the duodenocholedochal junction occurred and was repaired
surgically. Endoscopic papillotomy and stone extraction is a relatively safe and 
effective method of treating extrahepatic jaundice.

Inhibitory postsynaptic actions of taurine, GABA and other amino acids on
motoneurons of the isolated frog spinal cord.

Sonnhof U, Grafe P, Krumnikl J, Linder M, Schindler L.

The actions of glycine, GABA, alpha-alanine, beta-alanine and taurine were
studied by intracellular recordings from lumbar motoneurons of the isolated
spinal cord of the frog. All amino acids tested produced a reduction in the
amplitude of postsynaptic potentials, a blockade of the antidromic action
potential and an increase of membrane conductance. Furthermore, membrane
polarizations occurred, which were always in the same direction as the IPSP. All 
these effects indicate a postsynaptic inhibitory action of these amino acids.
When the relative strength of different amino acids was compared, taurine had the
strongest inhibitory potency, followed by beta-alanine, alpha-alanine, GABA and
glycine. Topically applied strychnine and picrotoxin induced different changes of
post-synaptic potentials, indicating that distinct inhibitory systems might be
influenced by these two convulsants. Interactions with amino acids showed that
picrotoxin seletively diminished the postsymaptic actions of GABA, while
strychnine reduced the effects of taurine, glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine. But 
differences in the susceptibility of these amino acid actions to strychnine could
be detected: the action of taurine was more sensitively blocked by strychnine
compared with glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine. With regard to these results the 
importance of taurine and GABA as transmitters of postsynaptic inhibition on
motoneurons in the spinal cord of the frog is discussed.

The involvement of lysophosphoglycerides in neurotransmitter release; the
composition and turnover of phospholipids of synaptic vesicles of guinea-pig
cerebral cortex and Torpedo electric organ and the effect of stimulation.

Baker RR, Dowdall MJ, Whittaker VP.

(1) Crude synaptosomal fractions (P2) derived from guinea-pig cerebral cortex
were incubated in the presence of 50 mM KCl in a Krebs-glucose medium. Torpedo
marmorata electric organs were stimulated electrically in vivo at 5 pulses/sec
for 30 min by electrodes placed on the electric lobe. Synaptic vesicles were
isolated from each source and the phospholipid compositions analysed and compared
with vesicles from unstimulated controls. (2) Lysophosphatidylcholine was the
only lysophosphoglyceride demonstrable in the synaptic vesicles from either
source and its low levels did not increase as a result of chemical or electircal 
stimulation. In each case there was a close similarity of the phospholipid
distributions in the vesicles taken from control and stimulated samples. (3)
Control experiments indicated extensive decreases in the acetylcholine content of
the vesicles from the stimulated electric organ and smaller decreases in the
acetylcholine content of the synaptic vesicles from stimulated crude synaptosomal
fractions. These fractions were found to respire linearly in the presence of 10
mM glucose and the vesicle fractions were shown to have low levels of
contaiminating membranes as judged by marker enzyme analyses. (4) Crude
synaptosomal fractions from guinea-pig cerebral cortex were incubated in a
Krebs-glucose medium with labelled fatty acids and [3H]glucose in the presence or
absence of 50 mM KCl. Subsynaptosomal fractionation was carried out and specific 
radioactivities of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine,
phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol were determined in fractions D
(synaptic vesicles), E (microsomes) and H (disrupted synaptosomes). The release
of neurotransmitter did not significantly enhance the labelling of phospholipids 
in any of the fractions studied as compared with phospholipids from unstimulated 
fractions. This was found after two incubation times and using [14C]oleate,
[14C]arachidonate, [3H]palmitate and [3H]glucose.

Cardiac output response to altered acid-base status during diethyl ether
anaesthesia.

Sodipo JO, Lee DC, Morris LE.

The effects of acid-base changes on cardiac output during diethyl ether
anaesthesia were studied in 25 mongrel dogs prepared by surgically implanting a
plastic encased non-ferrous core electromagnetic probe on the ascending aorta.
The findings are: (1) Metabolic acidaemia produced only slight decrease in
cardiac output but a more marked fall became evident with decreasing pH(2)
Respiratory acidaemia led to a slight rise in cardiac output. (3) Respiratory
alkalaemia decreased cardiac output. (4) Metabolic alkalaemia also produced a
decline in cardiac output.

The prevention of autolysis of stored cornea using steroid as a lysosome membrane
stabilizer.

Fook TJ, Ranadive NS, Basu PK.

Many eyes donated for use in corneal grafting are rejected because of signs of
autolysis in the donor material. The purpose of this experimental study was to
determine whether hydrocortisone acting as a lysosome membrane stabilizer could
prevent or retard autolysis of the corneas under storage, and if so, what was the
most efficacious concentration. Different groups of rabbit corneas were placed in
saline as controls or in varying concentrations of hydrocortisone (10(-10) M to
10(-4) M at pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C. Acid phosphatase released
after six hours was measured biochemically. This enzyme was used as a marker
enzyme reflecting lysosomal labilization. Results showed a significant
stabilization of the lysosomal membrane at 4 degrees C as compared to 37 degrees 
C. A trend towards stabilization of the lysosomal membrane was seen when 10(-8) M
concentration of hydrocortisone at 37 degrees C was used, there being no
demonstrable stabilization at 4 degrees C.

Respiratory effects of H+ and dinitrophenol injections into the brain stem
subarachnoid space of fetal lambs.

Jansen AH, Russell BJ, Chernick V.

Mock cerebrospinal fluid (pH 5.37-8.38) or 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) (0.15-1.5 mg) 
was injected into the subarachnoid space of the ventral brain stem of
exteriorized fetal sheep. Changes in pH on the ventral surface of the medulla did
not stimulate respiratory efforts or induce significant cardiovascular changes.
The respiratory response to DNP injections ranged from no response to prolonged
rhythmic ventilation that was independent of the peripheral chemoreceptors or the
control arterial pH and blood gas tensions. This inconsistency suggests an
effector site somewhat removed from the immediate surface of the medulla. The
heart rate and blood pressure were not affected. It is concluded that increased
H+ concentration in the extracellular fluid of the fetal ventral medulla does not
initiate respiration, and any respiratory response to metabolic inhibitors
applied to this area therefore is not attributable to a secondary change in
surface pH.

Soil fungistasis: elevation of the exogenous carbon and nitrogen requirements for
spore germination by fungistatic volatiles in soils.

Griffin GJ, Hora TS, Baker R.

Axenic, washed conidia of Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli, Aspergillus flavus,
and Verticillium albo-atrum were placed on washed Difco purified agar discs along
with an inorganic salt solution containing various levels of carbon and nitrogen 
substrates. These discs were exposed to volatiles from six soils (pH 5.1-8.6).
Fusarium solani macroconidial germination was inhibited mostly by volatiles from 
soils of pH 5.1, 6.1, 7.0, and 7.5, but high levels of glucose and NH4Cl reversed
this inhibition, raising germination to that of no-soil, no-carbon or nitrogen
controls. Conidial germination of A. flavus was inhibited mainly by volatiles
from high pH (7.0, 7.8, and 8.6) soils, and increased levels of glucose plus an
amino acid mixture nullified this inhibition. Volatiles from soils of pH 5.1,
6.1, and 7.5 stimulated A. flavus conidial germination. Assays after the removal 
of CO2 from the air above soil of pH 5.1 demonstrated that volatiles inhibitory
to A. flavus were produced by this soil. Assays indicated that a KOH-soluble
compound was a fungistatic soil volatile to F. solani macroconidial germination. 
The nullification by carbon and nitrogen substrates of F. solani and A. flavus
inhibition caused by soil volatiles parallels that for soil fungistasis. Conidial
germination of V. albo-atrum was markedly stimulated by volatiles in all soils
tested, and was not affected by removal of CO2. Inhibitory soil volatiles may
increase the nutritional requirements for spore germination of certain fungi.

Nitrofurazone-reducing enzymes in E. coli and their role in drug activation in
vivo.

McCalla DR, Olive P, Tu Y, Fan ML.

Earlier work showed that Escherichia coli contains at least two enzymes which
reduce nitrofurazone and other nitrofuran derivatives. One of these enzymes is
lacking in some nitrofurazone-resistant mutant strains. We now report that there 
are three separable nitrofuran reductases in this organism: reductase I (mol. wt.
approximately 50 000, insensitive to O2), reductase IIa (mol. wt. approximately
120 000, inhibited by oxygen), reductase IIb (mol. wt. approximately 700 000,
inhibited by O2). Unstable metabolites formed during the reduction of
nitrofurazone by preparations containing reductases IIa and IIb produce breaks in
DNA in vitro. In vivo experiments with nitrofurazone-resistant strains, which
lack reductase II but contain reductases IIa and IIb, demonstrated that
lethality, mutation, and DNA breakage are all greatly increased when cultures are
incubated under anaerobic conditions, i.e., conditions such that reductase II is 
active. These results provide further evidence for the importance of reductive
activation of nitrofurazone.

Enzymatic hydrolysis of agar: purification and characterization of neoagarobiose 
hydrolase and p-nitrophenyl alpha-galactoside hydrolase.

Day DF, Yaphe W.

The mixture of polysaccharides in the gelling component of agar (agarose) is
hydrolyzed to D-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose by a series of hydrolytic
enzymes obtained from Pseudomonas atlantica. The final degradative step in the
pathway of agarose decomposition is the hydrolysis of the alpha-linkage in the
dissaccharide neoagarobiose yielding D-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose.
Pseudomonas atlantica when grown on agar produces two specific enzymes,
p-nitrophenyl alpha-galactose hydrolase and neoagarobiose hydrolase. The
purification and partial characterization of both enzymes are presented.

Temperature and pH optima for 21 species of thermophilic and thermotolerant
fungi.

Rosenberg SL.

A glucose-containing mineral medium supplemented with 0.01% yeast extract is
described upon which all the species of thermophilic and thermotolerant fungi
tested will grow. Thirteen of the 21 species do not require the yeast extract
supplement for growth. Using this solid, supplemented mineral medium, the pH and 
temperature optima for growth of all strains were measured. No correlation was
found between temperature optimum and pH optimum among members of the group
tested.

Physiological differences among isolates of Phytophthora cinnamomi.

Kelley WD.

Significant differences in amylase, beta-glucosidase, and phosphatase activities 
were observed among four Phytophthora cinnamomi isolates grown in
nutrient-amended sterilized soil for 20 days. Amylase pH optima for the four
isolates were within a relatively narrow range; at pH 5.5 each isolate was within
90% of its peak activity. Isolates SB-216-1, 1-281, and C-39 each exhibited
maximal beta-glucosidase activity at pH 5.0 and maximal phosphatase activity at
pH 5.0-5.5. Maximal activity for these two enzymes of isolate A-7725 occurred at 
pH 3.5. In timed experiments, isolates 1-281 and A-7725 exhibited greater amylase
activities than did the other two isolates. For beta-glucosidase, greatest
activity was observed for SB-216-1; ACTivity of 1-281 was intermediate and least 
activity was observed for isolates A-7725 and C-39. Isolates SB-216-1 and 1-281
exhibited greatest phosphatase activities; isolate C-39 was intermediate in
activity, and A-7725 was least active. Results indicate that significant
differences exist among the isolates tested and that these differences can be
quantitatively measured by the methods described.

Regulation and properties of an invertase from Clostridium pasteurianum.

Laishley EJ.

An intracellular invertase was induced in cultures of Clostridium pasteurianum
utilizing sucrose as its carbon source for growth. This enzyme synthesis could be
repressed by the addition of fructose of a sucrose-growing culture. In contrast, 
invertase activity was not affected by the addition of glucose to sucrose-growing
cells and this enzyme could be induced in a glucose-metabolizing culture by the
addition of sucrose. This enzyme was purified 10.5-fold over the induced lese, EC
3.2.1.26) by substrate-specificity studies. Invertase had a pH optimum of 6.5 and
an apparent Km of 79.5 mM for sucrose, and required high concentration of
potassium phosphate for maximum activity. Invertase was completely inactivated by
a 2-min heat treatment at 60 degrees C. This enzyme was strongly inhibited by
p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (pCMB) and weakly inhibited by
5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), while cysteine could substantially reverse
pCMB) inhibition, suggesting that sulfhydryl group(s) were necessary for
invertase activity.

with Azotobacter electron transport function. Sonically disrupted Azotobacter
cells were examined for distribution of ATPase activity and the highest specific 
activity (and activity units) was consistently found in the particulate R3
membranous fraction which sediments on ultracentrifugation at 144 000 X g for 2
h. When the sonication time interval was increased, the membrane-bound ATPase
activity could neither be solubilized nor released into the supernatant fraction.
Optimal ATPase activty occurred at pH 8.0; Mg2+ ion when added to the assay was
stimulatory. Maximal activity always occurred when the Mg2+:ATP stoichiometry was
1:1 on a molar ratio at the 5 mM concentration level. Sodium and potassium ions
had no stimulatory effect. The reaction kinetics were linear for the time
intervals studied (0-60 min). The membrane-bound ATPase in the R3 fraction was
stimulated 12-fold by treatment wiTH TRypsin, and fractionation studies showed
that trypsin treatment did not solubilize ATPase activity off the membranous R3
electron transport fraction. The ATPase was not cold labile and the temperature
during the preparation of the R3 fraction had no effect on activity; overnight
refrigeration at 4 degrees C, however, resulted in a 25% loss of activity as
compared with a 14% loss when the R3 fraction was stored overnight at 25 degrees 
C. A marked inactivation (although variable, usually about 60%) did occur by
overnight freezing (-20 degrees C), and subsequent sonication failed to restore
ATPase activity. This indicates that membrane reaggregation (by freezing) was not
responsible for ATPase inactivation. The addition of azide, ouabain,
2,4-dinitrophenol, or oligomycin to the assay system resulted in neither
inhibition nor stimulation of the ATPase activity. The property of trypsin
activation and that ATPase activity is highest in the R3 electron transport
fraction suggests that its probable functional role is in coupling of electron
transport to oxidative phosphorylation.

Effects of zinc-smelter emissions on forest soil microflora.

Jordan MJ, Lechevalier MP.

Within 2 km of a zinc (Zn) smelter in Palmerton, Pennsylvania, near the Lehigh
Water Gap, up to 13.5% Zn by weight has been measured in the O2 horizon of the
soil, and up to 8% Zn in the A1 horizon. The total numbers of bacteria,
actinomycetes, and fungi (measured by dilution plate counts) were greatly reduced
in the most severely Zn-contaminated soils compared with control soils. The
reduction of microbial populations may be a partial cause of the decreased rate
of litter decomposition at Lehigh Gap. Growth of most bacteria from control sites
was reduced by 100 to 200 muM Zn, most actinomycetes by 100 muM Zn, and most
fungi by 100 to 1000 muM Zn in thin-Pablum extract agar (TPab). All the tested
actinomycetes and non-spore-forming bacteria isolated from Zn-contaminated Lehigh
Gap soils were Zn-tolerant, growing normally in media containing 600-2000 muM Zn.
Most fungi, regardless of source, were capable of at least 50% of normal growth
at 700 muM Zn. Zinc-tolerant bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi were readily
isolated from low-Zn soils, suggesting that selection for Zn tolerance may
proceed rapidly. Acidophilic Mortierella species have been selectively eliminated
near the smelter, apparently because of elevated soil pH. Peryronellaea glomerata
(Corda) Goidanich and Coniothyrium spp. were found only in the high-Zn soils.

The effects of the continuous administration of N,N-dimethyl-4-phenylazoaniline
(DAB) on the activities and the inducibilities of some drug-metabolizing enzymes 
in rat liver.

Autrup H, Thurlow BJ, Warwick GP.

(1) The effect of feeding a relatively low-protein diet containing 0.06% DAB for 
29 weeks on the activity of DAB-azoreductase, nitroreductase (p-nitrobenzoic
acid), N-oxidase (N,N-dimethylaniline), N-demethylase (DAB), cytochrome P-450,
NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, beta-glucuronidase and arylsulphatase A were
studied. Rapid decreases occurred in the activities of the first six enzymes,
reaching minimal values at between 4 and 8 weeks. Activities then increased in
all cases to control or nearly control levels. This rate of increase was least
for cytochrome P-450. At 4 weeks azoreductase activity with the chemotherapeutic 
agent CB10-252 (I) as substrate was significantly higher than in control rats.
Early increases occurred in the activities of beta-glucuronidase and
arylsulphatase A and the activity of the latter never dropped below the control
level. (2) An investigation was made of the differential effects of dye feeding
on some of the enzyme activities in the two major liver lobes and differences
were found. (3) The effect of phenobarbital (PB) pretreatment on the DAB-fed rats
was studied at 4-week intervals. The activities of DAB-azoreductase and of
nitroreductase increased throughout the whole period, while the activities of the
lysosomal enzymes were decreased. (4) After feeding DAB for 4 weeks the effect of
PB and 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) on the activities of DAB-azoreductase,
CB10-252-azoreductase and components of the azoreductases-cytochrome P-450,
NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, the CO-CB10-252-azoreductase was not induced by PB 
or MC, and CO did not inhibit its reduction. Its reduction depended only slightly
on NADH. CO caused a greater relative decrease in the activity of
DAB-azoreductase in dye-fed animals and also in animals following PB and MC
pretreatment, implying a greater role of cytochrome P-450 in dye-fed animals.

Some characteristics of two azoreductase systems in rat liver. Relevance to the
activity of 2-[4'-di(2"-bromopropyl)-aminophenylazo]benzoic acid (CB10-252), a
compound possessing latent cytotoxic activity.

Autrup H, Warwick GP.

The system involved in the reduction of 2-[4'-di(2''-bromopropyl)
aminophenylazolbenzoic acid (CB10-252), an agent designed for treating primary
liver cell cancer, has been demonstrated to be localised mainly in the 108 000 X 
g supernatant fraction of rat liver homogenate. It is also present in other
organs particularly in the spleen. DAB-azoreductase as shown previously is
present almost entirely in the microsomal fraction and is found in high
concentration only in liver. The pH maximum for CB10-252-azoreductase implying
the importance of the 2'-carboxyl group in determining substrate specificity. The
use of enzyme inhibitors and other additives showed that CB10-252 WAS NOT
AXANTHINE OXIDASE OR DIHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE. Its activity was not affected by
carbon monoxide, phenobarbitone (PB), or 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) pretreatment. 
Enhancement of the activity by ferrous ions and FAD indicated that at least part 
of the reduction system could involve a flavoprotein with FAD as the prosthetic
group. The activity of CB10-252-azoreductase and methylred-azoreductase was
reduced by menadione (vitamin K3), cyanide and propylgallate. A diaphorase
preparation from pig heart reduced both CB10-252 and methylred with both NADPH-
and NADH-generating systems.

Mercury inhibition of avian fatty acid synthetase complex.

Donaldson WE.

(1) Subcutaneous or intra-abdominal injections of 8 mg of HgCl2/100 g body weight
markedly depressed hepatic fatty acid synthetase activity of chicks at 1 h
post-injection. The depression occurred despite the fact that the chicks
continued to eat up until the time they were killed. Under these same conditions,
the hepatic activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2) was not affected by
HgCl2, while the activity of the mitochondrial system of fatty acid elongation
was stimulated. (2) When 2-mercaptoethanol was included in the incubation medium 
for a highly purified preparation of fatty acid synthetase, 500 muM HgCl2 was
required to show definite inhibition of the enzyme. When 2-mercaptoethanol was
omitted, 50 muM HgCl2 was inhibitory and 100 muM HgCl2 abolished enzyme activity.
(3) 2 mM dithiothreitol completely protected the purified fatty acid synthetase
preparation from inhibition by 100 muM HgCl2. When dithiothreitol was added after
the addition of enzyme to the mercury-containing medium, protection of the enzyme
was not complete. (4) Dialysis of cytosol fractions from chicks injected with
HgCl2 against 500 vol. of 0.2 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 
mM EDTA and 10 mM dithiothreitol for 4 h at 4 degrees stimulated the fatty acid
synthetase activity of the fractions. Dialysis of cytosol fractions from
noninjected chicks under the same conditions was without effect on fatty acid
synthetase activity. (5) These data support the hypothesis that the inhibitory
effect of HgCl2 administered in vivo on hepatic fatty acid synthetase activity in
chicks is mediated through the interaction of mercury with the sulfhydryl groups 
of the enzyme.

[Basic phospholipase of Naja nigricollis venom].

[Article in French]

Dumarey C, Sket D, Joseph D, Boquet P.

It is confirmed that N. nigricollis venom contains several phospholipases one of 
these is a basic phospholipase A. This enzyme is toxic for mice when injected
intravenously. In vitro it reacts on egg yolk lecithin producing lysolecithin and
prevents the phenomenon of blood clotting. An immunological identity has been
established between this basic phospholipase and two acidic phospholipases
present in the same venom.

Effects of decreasing arterial blood pressure on cerebral blood flow in the
baboon. Influence of the sympathetic nervous system.

Fitch W, MacKenzie ET, Harper AM.

The influence of the sympathetic nervous system on the cerebral circulatory
response to graded reductions in mean arterial blood pressure was studied in
anesthetized baboons. Cerebral blood flow was measured by the 133Xe clearance
method, and arterial blood pressure was decreased by controlled hemorrhage. In
normal baboons, the constancy of cerebral blood flow was maintained until mean
arterial blood pressure was approximately 65% of the base-line value; thereafter,
cerebral blood flow decreased when arterial blood pressure was reduced. Superior 
cervical sympathectomy of 2-3 weeks duration did not affect the normal response. 
In contrast, both acute surgical sympathectomy (cervical trunk division) and
alpha-receptor blockade (1.5 mg/kg of phenoxybenzamine) enhanced the maintenance 
of cerebral blood flow in the face of hemorrhagic hypotension in that cerebral
blood flow did not decrease until mean arterial blood pressure was approximately 
35% of the base-line value. The results indicate that the sympathetic nervous
system is not involved in the maintenance of cerebral blood flow in the face of a
fall in arterial blood pressure. Indeed, the implication is that the
sympathicoadrenal discharge accompanying hemorrhagic hypotension is detrimental
to, rather than responsible for, cerebral autoregulation.

Influence of hematocrit, blood gas tensions, and pH on pressure-flow relations in
the isolated canine lung.

Bucens D, Pain MC.

An isolated perfused canine lung preparation in which determinants of vascular
caliber could be individually controlled was developed. The relation of pulmonary
arterial (Pa), venous (PV), and alveolar (PA) pressures was such that Pa greater 
than PA greater than PV throughout the whole lung. The addition of isoprenaline
to the perfusate abolished vascular reactivity. Once stability was reached,
vascular cross-sectional area remained acceptably constant for 2.25 hours as
judged by normalized conductance. The influence of perfusate hematocrit, blood
gas tensions, and pH on pressure-flow relations was then studied in 15 isolated
canine lungs. The hematocrit-vascular conductance relation was derived at
constant perfusion pressure. Conductance varied linearly with hematocrit over a
range of 16.5 to 89.5%. Mean pulmonary arterial blood gas tensions were: PO2 =
121 mm Hg, PCO2 = 28 mm Hg, and pH = 7.46. Acute respiratory acidosis (PO2 = 30
mm Hg, PCO2 = 81 mm Hg, pH = 7.17) and lactic acidosis and hypoxemia (PO2 = 32 mm
Hg, PCO2 = 21 mm Hg, pH = 6.96) did not significantly alter this relation.
Transformation of the conductance-hematocrit data indicated that hematocrit was
the most important determinant of relative apparent viscosity of the blood. Both 
acute respiratory and lactic acidosis failed to significantly increase relative
viscosity within the range of hematocrit usually found in secondary polycythemia.

Interaction of the chemoreflex and the pulmonary inflation reflex in the
regulation of coronary circulation in conscious dogs.

Vatner SF, McRitchie RJ.

The interaction of chemoreflex and pulmonary inflation reflex control of the
coronary circulation was examined in conscious dogs by comparing the responses to
chemoreflex stimulation (intracarotid injection of nicotine) when ventilation was
allowed to increase with those when ventilation was controlled. The responses
were also compared with those elicited by both forced mechanical and spontaneous 
hyperinflation. When the heart rate was constant, intracarotidly administered
nicotine induced an increase in the depth of respiration followed closely by an
increase in late diastolic coronary flow from 48 +/- 2 to 106 +/- 8 ml/min and a 
reduction in late diastolic coronary resistance from 1.62 +/- 0.08 to 0.78 +/-
0.06 mm Hg/ml min-1. After beta-receptor and cholinergic blockade, a similar
coronary dilation in response to nicotine occurred only when ventilation was
allowed to increase. However, when ventilation was controlled, intracarotidly
administered nicotine increased coronary resistance after combined beta-receptor 
and cholinergic blockade. The reflex coronary dilation was not observed after
carotid sinus nerve section or after alpha-receptor blockade. Thus, nicotine
stimulation of the carotid chemoreflex results in a striking coronary dilation
that has two components. The minor component involves a chemoreflex with its
efferent pathway in tthe vagi. The major component of coronary dilation follows
an increase in the depth of respiration, and its efferent component appears to
involve withdrawal of alpha-adrenergic constrictor tone. An almost identical
period of reflex coronary dilation followed either forced mechanical or
spontaneous hyperinflation in the conscious dog.

Effect of coronary blood flow on glycolytic flux and intracellular pH in isolated
rat hearts.

Neely JR, Whitmer JT, Rovetto MJ.

The rate of coronary blood flow was varied in isolated working rat heart
preparations to determine its influence on the rate of glocose utilization,
tissue high-energy phosphates, and intracellular pH. A 60% reduction in coronary 
blood flow resulted in a 30% reduction in oxygen consumption, an accelerated rate
of glusoe utilization, lower tissue levels of high-energy phosphate, and higher
tissue levels of lactate and H+. Ventricular performance deteriorated as
reflected by a decrease in heart rate and peak systolic pressure. Further
reductions in coronary blood flow resulted in inhibition of glycolysis, a greater
decrease in tissue levels of high-energy phosphates, and higher tissue levels of 
both lactate and H+. These changes in glycolytic flux, tissue metabolites, and
ventricular performance were proportional to the degree of restriction in
coronary blood flow. The importance of coronary blood flow and washout of the
interstitial space in the maintenance of accelerated glycolytic flux in
oxygen-deficient hearts is emphasized. It is concluded that acceleration of ATP
production from glycolysis can occur only in the marginally ischemic tissue in
the peripheral area of tissue supplied by an occluded artery. The central area of
tissue which receives a low rate of coronary blood flow will have a reduced rate 
of ATP production due to both a lack of oxygen and an inhibition of glycolysis.

Mechanisms of glycolytic inhibition in ischemic rat hearts.

Rovetto MJ, Lamberton WF, Neely JR.

The mechanisms of glycolytic inhibition in ischemic myocardium were investigated 
in the isolated, perfused rat heart. Glycolysis was inhibited at the level of
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The major factors that accounted for
the glycolytic inhibition in the ischemic heart compared with the anoxic heart
appeared to be higher tissue levels of lactate and H+ in the ischemic tissue.
Increased extracellular pH inhibited glycolysis in anoxic and hypoxic hearts much
more readily than it did in aerobic hearts. However, maintenance of both
extracellular and intracellular pH caused only a modest acceleration of
glycolysis in ischemic hearts. Accumulation of tissue lactate and inhibition of
glycolysis were directly proportional to the reduction in coronary bloow flow in 
both anoxic and ischemic hearts. At intracellular lactate concentrations between 
15 and 20 mM, glycolysis was inhibited under both conditions. Addition of either 
10, 20, or 40 mM lactate to the perfusate inhibited glycolysis in aerobic,
anoxic, and ischemic hearts. The effect of lactate did not appear to be mediated 
through changes in intracellular pH. It is concluded that accumulation of lactate
represents a major factor in the inhibition of glycolysis that develops in
ischemic hearts.

Comparison of contractile performance of canine atrial and ventricular muscles.

Urthaler F, Walker AA, Hefner LL, James TN.

This study compared the contractile performance of a canine right atrial
trabecula with that of a macroscopically indistinguishable trabecula isolated
from the right ventricular apex. The heart was removed from nine mongrel puppies 
weighing 6-8 kg and placed in Krebs-Ringer's bicarbonate solution. The bathing
solution contained only 1.25 mmoles of Ca2+ and was bubbled with a 95% O2-5% CO2 
gas mixture. Each atrial trabecula was specially selected from the right atrial
appendage. Histologically, these trabeculae showed a remarkable longitudinal
orientation of the fibers. At Lmax (the length of the muscle at which developed
tension was maximum) under identical conditions of temperature, rate of
stimulation, ionic milieu, pH, and O2 and CO2 supply, right atrial trabeculae
achieved the same developed and total tensions but in a much shorter time than
did ventricular trabeculae. In both muscle groups the maximum developed tension
averaged about 2.5 g/mm2. Since Lo (expressed as a fraction of Lmax) was less in 
atrial muscle than it was in ventribular muscle, we concluded that atrial muscle 
can be stretched considerably more than can ventricular muscle before optimum
length is reached. At any given initial muscle length, the maximum of tension
rise for atrial trabeculae amounted to at least twice that for ventricular
trabeculae. At any given load up to 1.5 g/mm2, the maximum velocity of shortening
of an atrial trabecula was about three to four times that of a ventricular
trabecula. These results collectively indicate that the contractile performance
of the right atrial muscle is in many respects superior to that of the right
ventricle, at least under the conditions of these experiments.

Serum lactate dehydrogenase activity ratios with different substrates.

Barlow D, Naghizadeh F, King J.

1. The lactate dehydrogenase activity of 89 sera from patients suffering
myocardial infarction and of 55 sera from patients with hepatocellular damage was
assayed under optimal conditions using pyruvate, alpha-oxobutyrate,
hydroxypyruvate and glyoxylate as substrates. Activity was also measured with
lactate as substrate at different pH values. 2. The ratios of activities under
these different assay conditions were calculated for both series of patients.
Correct differentiations for single ratios ranged from virtually nil for
hydroxypyruvate/alpha-oxobutyrate to is greater than 93 per cent for
glyoxylate/hydroxypyruvate and glyoxylate/alpha-oxobutyrate. This was little
improved by the use of multiple ratios involving up to seven separate assays. 3. 
The activity ratio of hydroxypyruvate to pyruvate which is consistently greater
than unity was found to be inverted in a case of morphine poisoning.

Fluorometric assay for N-acetylprocainamide.

Matusik E, Gibson TP.

We describe a simple, rapid fluorometric assay for separate quantitative analysis
of procainamide and N-acetylprocainamide in mixtures. The effective lenear range 
(fluorescence vs. concentration) in serum is 0.1 to 10.0 mg/liter, regardless of 
the ratio (by weight) of the two drugs from 1:10 to 10:1. Analytical recoveries
by the extraction method used were 100.0 +/- 3.0% and 98.0 +/- 4.0%,
respectively. For determination of either compound, the maximum coefficient of
variation was 10%.

Rapid kinetic measurement of lactate in plasma with a centrifugal analyzer.

Pesce MA, Bodourian SH, Nicholson JF.

In this method, blood is collected in ammonium heparinized microhematocrit tubes 
and lactate is directly determined in the plasma, separated within 15 min from
the erythrocytes. Lactate is assayed by mixing 10 mul of sample with NAD+ and
lactate dehydrogenase in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrazine buffer. The
rate of increase in absorbance of the NADH formed, measured at 340 nm, is
proportional to lactate concentration. The assay is complete in 4 min and
absorbance is linearly related to concentration from 0.625 to 15 mmol/liter.
Analytical recoveries of lactate added to plasma averaged 104% (range, 91-116%). 
Results compared well for plasma samples analyzed by this method with the
CentrifiChem and the Du Pont aca.

appropriate area of the electrophoretogram is cut out, sewn onto a second sheet
of paper, and rerun at pH 1.9. By this method, amino acids are rapidly resolved. 
It is suited for use with special procedures such as oxidation of biological
fluid with performic acid and specific staining for confirmation of amino acid
identification.

A clinical method for the determination of serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase.

Tamaoki H, Minato S, Takei S, Fujisawa K.

A simple, highly sensitive and reproducible method for the assay of
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (EC 2.3.2-) activity is introduced, using
gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide as a substrate and glycylglycine as an acceptor in 
50 g/l of polyoxyethylene nonylphenol. Serum transpeptidase activity was assayed 
in 1080 healthy adults, the normal mean value being 14.8 mU/ml. The diagnostic
evaluation of the enzyme in various hepatobiliary diseases is also discussed.

Treatment of renal hypertension.

Losse H.

There are different types of renal hypertension: hypertension due to parenchymal 
renal disease, renovascular hypertension, hypertension due to urological disease,
hypertension of endstage renal disease. Treatment has to consider-above all-the
possibility of specific, medical or surgical procedures that may cause the
underlying condition. If the underlying disease is not amenable to specific
therapy, symptomatic medical treatment to lower blood pressure is indicated:
besides control of sodium-intake and body weight antihypertensive drugs are
generally indicated. We use them, alone or in combination, in the following line 
of order: diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, dihydralazine, reserpine,
clonidine, alpha-methyldopa, guanethidine.

Effects of graded infusions of monomethylmethacrylate on coagulation, blood
lipids, respiration and circulation. An experimental study in dogs.

Modig J, Busch C, Waernbaum G.

In 4 dogs injected intravenously (i.v.) with 125I labeled fibrinogen, 51Cr
labeled platelets and 99mTc labeled albumin, and subjected to successively
increasing amounts of i.v. infused monomethylmethacrylate, doses corresponding to
the amounts released into the blood stream following implantation of acrylic
cement during total hip replacements did not affect the clotting mechanism, did
not cause trapping of platelets and fibrin in the lungs, did not generate fat
emboli, and did not cause depression of the arterial oxygen tension or blood
pressure. Monomethylmethacrylate in whole blood was associated with both blood
cells and plasma.

Anaerobic glycolysis in normal human erythrocytes incubated in vitro with sodium 
salicylate.

Worathumrong N, Grimes AJ.

1. Some effects of sodium salicylate upon anaerobic glycolysis have been studied 
in normal human erythrocytes incubated for up to 6 h at 37 degrees C in
autologous sera. 2. Both glucose consumption and lactate production were
stimulated by concentrations of salicylate up to 60 mmol/l but at the highest
concentration used (90 mmol/l) an initial stimulus was followed by inhibition of 
glycolysis. 3. Losses occurred of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), adenosine
5'-diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine 5'-phosphate(AMP)at higher concentrations of
salicylate and there was a concomitant increase of inorganic phosphate. 4. Other 
phosphate esters underwent concentration changes at higher concentrations of
salicylate that reflected inadequate concentrations of ATP for glycolysis. 5. The
rates of sodium efflux from, and potassium influx into, erythrocytes were
unaffected by the presence of salicylate at concentrations sufficient to
stimulate glycolysis.

Arterial catecholamines in hypoxic exercise in man.

Clancy LJ, Critchley JA, Leitch AG, Kirby BJ, Ungar A, Flenley DC.

1. We measured the minute ventilation and arterial blood catecholamine
concentrations in four normal men standing and at two levels of moderate
treadmill exercise breathing 14% oxygen or air. 2. Minute ventilation was
significantly higher during hypoxic exercise than during normoxic exercise at an 
oxygen uptake of 1500 ml/min. 3. Arterial plasma noradrenaline during hypoxic
exercise at an oxygen uptake of 1500 ml/min was significantly greater than at
rest. 4. Arterial plasma noradrenaline during normoxic exercise at an oxygen
uptake of 1500 ml/min was not elevated above the resting concentration. 5. The
results are compatible with the suggestion that increased concentrations of
arterial plasma noradrenaline contribute to the hypoxic potentiation of the
respiratory response to moderate exercise.

Influence of pH and hypoxia on the success of defibrillation.

Yakaitis RW, Thomas JD, Mahaffey JE.

Clinical impressions about the problem of defibrillation during states of
acid-base imbalance and hypoxia have been influenced by studies involving the
effect of these derangements on the ventricular fibrillation threshold. Based on 
body weight, energy requirements for defibrillation in normal dogs were compared 
to requirements in dogs subjected to commonly encountered acid-base disturbances 
and severe hypoxemia. No significant differences were found. Seventy-five percent
of all animals in the study were electrically converted with low-to-moderate
levels of energy. The incidence of spontaneous resumption of circulation
following defibrillation was lowest in animals subjected to metabolic acidosis
and hypoxia. The results suggest that pH and blood gas alterations, previously
shown to influence the normal ventricular fibrillation threshold, do not
significantly affect the normal defibrillation threshold.

Pleural effusion associated with aortitis syndrome.

Kawai T, Yamada Y, Tsuneda J, Aoyagi T, Mikata A.

A patient with aortitis syndrome had a pleural effusion which subsided but
reappeared with an exacerbation of aortitis symptoms while under antituberculosis
treatment. The character of the fluid was that of an exudate, and the glucose
concentration was normal. Clinical and laboratory features of the case suggest
that the effusion was part of the aortitis syndrome per se.

Charge properties of human pituitary and amniotic fluid prolactins.

Rogol AD, Ben-David M, Sheats R, Rodbard D, Chrambach A.

The apparent isoelectric points (pI) in isoelectric focusing (IF) of human
pituitary and amniotic fluid prolactin (hPRL), both non-iodinated and iodinated, 
were determined. Unresolved mixtures of pituitary hPRL isohormones E and F, and
of at least five isohormones found in amniotic fluid, and plasma hPRL exhibit an 
average pI value of 6.5 - 6.7. Transient state pH values observed or previously
reported for hPRL components range from pH 5.9 to 6.8 after correction to
standard conditions. At pH 8.1, the major isohormone, hPRL-F, carriers a charge
of 2.2 net protons per molecule. The net charge differences among isohormones E, 
F and G are compatible with acquisition or loss of single charged groups per
20,000 molecular weight. This net charge is similar to that of the least
prolactin-bioactive major isohormone of human growth hormone (hGH-B), while the
hGH with a bioactivity comparable to that of hPRL exhibits a net charge of 3.4
valence units. The "large" isohormones J and H increased net charges, by a factor
of 2-3, in direct proportion to their size increments.

Human and monkey prolactin and growth hormone: separation of polymorphic forms by
isoelectric focusing.

Hummel BC, Brown GM, Hwang P, Friesen HG.

The feasibility of using isoelectric focusing for the separation of primate
pituitary growth hormone from prolactin and for the characterization of
polymorphic forms of these hormones was explored. In a pH 3--10 gradient,
extracts of both human and cynomolgus monkey pituitaries were each resolved into 
4 growth hormone components and at least 3 prolactin components, as shown by
radioimmunoassay. In narrower gradients (of 2--3 pH units) greater resolution was
achieved; the principal growth hormone components were well separated from the
principal prolactin components but there was overlapping of some minor
components. A partially purified human prolactin preparation was found to contain
4 prolactin components, one of which had a prolactin/growth hormone ratio of 760.
Clinical grade human growth hormone was also resolved into at least 5 prolactin
and 5 growth hormone components, many of which had higher pI values than those
found in pituitary extract. Under the conditions used, both growth hormone and
prolactin were found to be polymorphic with respect to isoelectric point. Some of
the human prolactin components were found to contain less than 0.2% growth
hormone by radioimmunoassay. Monkey growth hormone containing 0.01% prolactin was
isolated. These findings demonstrate that isoelectric focusing is useful for the 
preparation of both growth hormone and prolactin which are essentially free of
one another. Furthermore, the polymorphic forms were repeatedly found in
preparations obtained by several methods and from 2 different species, suggesting
that these forms are not artifacts.

Ecological observation of the 137Cs-contamination in beef of animals from the
southern-Bavarian area.

Kreuzer W.

Certain climatic and edaphic conformations in the Bavarian sub-alpine mountains
and in the Alps favor above all the development of a land utilization system and 
farm structures similar to those in the northern part of Scandinavia. In 1963/64,
the years of the highest environmental contamination up to the present, we
established in 600 beef samples from the round or shoulder of male and female
cattle (mainly Highland cattle) close connections between the 137Cs-contamination
of green crop and the long lastnig yearly precipitation quantities, as well as
certain relations between the 137Cs-contamination of meat and differences in the 
feeding and keeping of the animals. During summer-seasons (April-October), beef
of cattle from pastures with heavy rainfall (Alps) was contaiminated by 137Cs up 
to 15 times more than that of confined animals. Hereby the rate of
137Cs-contamination in the meat of grazing cattle was nearly proportional to the 
quantities of precipitation. When confined cattle were fed on pastures in autumn 
after harvesting for 2 to 3 weeks, a quick increase of 137Cs-contamination of the
meat was caused within this time up to values which in this district were
otherwise only observed in grazing cattle. The lower 137Cs-content in meat of
cattle housed during the summer season is due to the more varied fodder, which is
at that time less contaminated than green crop. During the winter season
(November to March), the highest contaminations in the meat of confined (Bohemian
Forest) or grazing cattle (Alps) was measured when the animals in these districts
were almost exclusively fed with fodder from the own farmground or with leafy
silage. The highest contamination was almost regularly noticed in January,
February and March, as generally during these months the highly contaminated
first cut hay is fed. Here the meat was often even more contaminated than that of
grazing cattle. After the quick decrease of 137Cs in fallout noticed in the years
1964 and 1965, in 1965/66 a dependance in the 137Cs-contamination of beef on the 
methods of keeping and feeding could still be observed in only the extreme cases 
(Alps, Bavarian- and Bohemian Forest); though in general, meat of animals from
districts with heavy rainfall was slightly more contaminated than meat of animals
from regions with less precipitation.

Liver microsomal beta-glucuronidase and UDP-glucuronyltransferase.

Schöllhammer I, Poll DS, Bickel MH.

Both UDP-glucuronyltransferase (GT) and beta-glucuronidase (betaG) were assayed
in untreated liver microsomes. Optimum assay conditions were established with rat
liver microsomes using p-nitrophenol (pNP) and its glucuronide (pNPGA) at the pH 
optima of GT (7.5) and betaG (4.5). The activities of the two enzymes were
compared using microsomes from rats, mice, pigs, cattle and horses, with pNP,
pNPGA, and phenolphthalein as substrate, in the presence of various cofactors and
inhibitors at pH 7.5 and 4.5. These data disclose pronounced differences with
respect to species, substrate and other experimental conditions, thereby
precluding the establishment of general optimum conditions. The two enzymes were 
also assayed under strictly identical conditions using pNP and pNPGA and rat
liver microsomes at pH 7.5 in the presence and absence of UDP-glucuronate
disodium (UDPGA), activators (ATP;UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) and inhibitors. When
provided with a functional level of UDPGA, both enzymes proved active under those
conditions, and a conjugation-deconjugation interplay was indicated. The two
processes could be selectively and totally inhibited by Zn2+ and saccharolactone.
The results suggest that conjugation-deconjugation-reconjugation cycles may be
operative in the metabolism of drugs in vivo, taking place already at the level
of the liver endoplasmic reticulum.

Biochemical aspects of renal ammonia formation in metabolic acidosis.

Hems DA.

In omnivorous creatures, the diet is acidogenic, especially as a result of the
meat content, which gives rise to phosphoric and sulphuric acids, i.e., to
metabolic acidosis. In the short term, metabolic acids are buffered by tissue
proteins and bicarbonate (the 'alkali reserve'). In the longer term, acid must be
excreted, or neutralized with base which is also generated from the diet, by
conversion of dietary amino-nitrogen to ammonia. The final steps of this process 
occur in the kidney, which converts circulating glutamine to ammonia, and to
carbon products such as glucose and carbon dioxide, by metabolic reactions which 
adapt during acidosis to generate more ammonia and maintain an increased renal
ammonia content. The complex mechanisms which govern the formation of ammonia,
glucose and carbon dioxide from glutamine, involving the reactions of amino
acids, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and gluconeogenesis, are reviewed.

Studies on the mechanism of the changes in serum and liver gamma-glutamyl
transpeptidase activity. I. Experimental extrahepatic cholestasis in rabbits.

Adjarov D, Popov S, Ivanov E.

Serum, liver and renal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) activities were
studied in four groups of rabbits: controls, rabbits with obstructive
extrahepatic cholestasis, rabbits with obstructive anuria, and animals with
combined obstructive extrahepatic cholestasis and obstructive anuria. Serum GGT
was essentially increased in rabbits with obstructive extrahepatic cholestasis,
showing peak values in the combined cholestasis + obstructive anuria group, and
practically normal values in animals with anuria. Liver GGT was increased in both
cholestasis groups, but the increase was less prominent than the increase in
serum GGT and there was no correlation between them. In both anuric groups renal 
GGT was reduced, probably as a result of inhibited enzyme synthesis secondary to 
the altered conditions for adequate renal function. The results obtained are
suggestive of a probable renal involvement in the formation of the serum GGT
activity level.

Studies on the mechanism of the changes in serum and liver gamma-glutamyl
transpeptidase activity. II. Experimental hexachlorobenzene porphyria in rabbits.

Ivanov E, Krustev L, Adjarov D, Chernev K, Apostolov I, Dimitrov P, Drenska E,
Stefanova M, Pramatarova V.

The mechanism responsible for the changes in serum and liver gamma-glutamyl
transpeptidase (gamma-GT) activity was studied in a model of experimental
hexachlorobenzene porphyria in rabbits. Porphyria followed the administration of 
hexachlorobenzene in doses of 280 mumol - kg-1 body weight, which were given
daily through a gastric tube over a 20-day period. Serum gamma-GT activity and
the activities of the lysosomal enzymes beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and
alpha-mannosidase were increased, whereas L-aspartate: 2-oxoglutarate
aminotransferase and L-alanine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase and L-alanine:
2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase remained unaltered. There was a considerable
increase in liver microsomal protein, gamma-GT, cytochrome P-450,
anilinehydroxylase, aminopyrine-demethylase and delta-aminolevulinic acid
synthase. In the liver gamma-GT was detected in the microsomes as well as in the 
cytoplasm where enzymatic activity was higher. The high correlation coefficient
between liver gamma-GT, cytochrome P-450 and delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase
witnesses a hexachlorobenzene-induced gamma-GT formation in the liver. A
statistically significant correlation between serum and liver gamma-GT activity
was also found. These data strongly suggest that the increase in serum gamma-GT
activity may result from the induction of the enzyme in the liver.

Changes in erythrocyte 2,3 diphosphoglycerate in women following short term
maximal exercise.

Bonner HW, Tate CA, Buffington CK.

15 untrained women were subjected to a walking treadmill test to determine the
influence of maximal exercise upon synthesis of erythrocyte 2,3 DPG. Although
there was a 9.8% increase in the 2,3 DPG content following exercise, there was a 
concomitant 9.4% increase in the hemoglobin level; therefore, when 2,3 DPG is
expressed as a ratio to hemoglobin (See Article), there was no significant change
as a result of exercise stress. It was suggested that three additive factors
produced during strenuous exercise; decreased pH; increased hemoglobin
concentration; and increased CO2 production result in by-product inhibition of
2,3 DPG synthesis. It is concluded that 2,3 DPG does not provide a physiologic
benefit in the adaptation of the oxygen transport system to exercise.

Hydroxylation of p-Coumaric acid by illuminated chloroplasts. The role of
superoxide.

Halliwell B.

1. Chloroplasts isolated from leaves of spinach-beet (Beta vulgaris L. ssp.
vulgaris) do not catalyse the hydroxylation of p-coumaric acid in the dark unless
a reductant (such as ascorbate, NADH or NADPH) is added. Superoxide dismutase has
no effect on this reaction. 2. Illuminated chloroplasts catalyse the
hydroxylation in the absence of added reductant. This reaction is completely
inhibited by superoxide dismutase, but catalase has little effect. 3. Both
hydroxylation in the light and hydroxylation in the dark in the presence of
reductants are inhibited by diethyldithiocarbamate, EDTA, cyanide and
2-mercaptoethanol. 4. It is proposed that O-2- generated by illuminated
chloroplasts is involved in the provision of a reductant to the enzyme phenolase.

Identification of chloride-binding sites in hemoglobin by
nuclear-magnetic-resonance quadrupole-relaxation studies of hemoglobin digests.

Chiancone E, Norne JE, Forsén S, Bonaventura J, Brunori M, Antonini E, Wyman J.

35Cl minus-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies indicate that various digests
of human hemoglobin with carboxypeptidase A and B, or a combination of the two,
may be used for the identification of chloride binding sites. All the digestion
products contain, like hemoglobin itself, at least two classes of binding sites, 
one of high, the others of low affinity. The pH dependence of the excess
linewidth of the 35Cl minus NMR signal indicates that in the simple digests with 
either carboxypeptidase A or B, chloride is bound with high affinity at or near
His-beta146-Asp-beta94 and at or near Val-alpha1-Arg-alpha141. The high-affinity 
sites show, in the case of the simple digests, a strong oxygen linkage which is
lost in the forms digested with both carboxypeptidase A and B; this linkage may
thus be correlated to the presence of conformational changes. Organic phosphates,
like inositol hexaphosphate, show competition for some of the high-affinity
chloride binding sites in hemoglobin and in the simple digests. This competition 
is likewise lost in the doubly digested hemoglobins.

The internal-alkaline pH gradient, sensitive to uncoupler and ATPase inhibitor,
in growing Clostridium pasteurianum.

Riebeling V, Thauer RK, Jungermann K.

1. The intracellular pH was measured in growing Clostridium pasteurianum with and
acid-base equilibrium distribution method. [14C]Dimethyloxazolidinedione,
[14]methylamine and [14C]acetic acid were used as "deltapH-indicators". During
growth the extracellular pH decreased from 7.1 to 5.1; simultaneously the
intracellular pH changed from 7.5 to 5.9. Thus, the intracellular pH was more
alkaline than the extracellular pH by 0.4 to 0.8 pH-units. 2. This pH gradient
(interior alkaline) was abolished by the proton conductor carbonylcyanide
m-chlorophenylhydrazone and the ATPase inhibitor N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.
The pH gradient could not be demonstrated in cells depleted of an energy
substrate. These results suggest that the pH gradient is formed by an
ATPase-driven extrusion of protons from the cells rather than by a Donnan
potential. 3. Growth of the organism was inhibited by low concentrations of both 
carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (5 muM) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (5
muM). This finding suggests that the pH gradient is essential for the growing
cell as it may be required for substrate accumulation and other types of
transport processes.

D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase in the bacterial form and L-form of Proteus
mirabilis.

Martin HH, Maskos C, Burger R.

Membranes of the bacterial form and the stable and unstable L-forms of Proteus
mirabilis contain LD and DD-carboxypeptidase. The DD-carboxypeptidase is
inhibited non-competitively by penicillin G. The enzyme of the bacterial form is 
highly penicillin-sensitive (Ki - 4 X 10(-9) M penicillin G). Inhibition is only 
partly reversible by treatment with penicillinase or by dialysis against buffer. 
In contrast, the DD-carboxypeptidase of the unstable L-form, grown in the
presence of penicillin, is 175-fold less penicillin-sensitive (Ki = 7 X 10(7) M
penicillin G). Inhibition is completely reversed by penicillinase or dialysis.
After inhibition by penicillin and subsequent reactivation the penicillin
sensitivity of the bacterial DD-carboxtpeptidase is similar to the sensitivity of
the enzyme of the unstable L-form. The hypothesis is proposed that P. mirabilis
contains two DD-carboxypeptidases of different penicillin sensitivity and with
different mechanisms of penicillin binding. Peptidoglycan synthesis in the cell
walls of the unstable L-form is probably carried out with the help of only one
DD-carboxypeptidase, viz. the completely reactivatable enzyme with the lower
penicillin sensitivity.

Pigeon-liver NAD kinase. The structural and kinetic basis of regulation of NADPH.

Apps DK.

NAD kinase was purified from pigeon liver by an improved procedure which included
chromatography on phosphocellulose. The resultant preparation was homogeneous as 
judged by gel electrophoresis, but electrofocusing gave indications of
heterogeneity. The enzyme appeared to be of molecular weight 270000, and to
consist of subunits of molecular weight 34000; it may therefore be an octomer.
Kinetic studies over a wide range of substrate concentrations revealed departures
from Michaelis-Menten behaviour with the substrate NAD+; these were interpreted
tentatively in terms of negative homotropic interactions between identical
binding sites, since thermal and chemical inactivation studies revealed no
evidence for more than one type of catalytic site. The significance of the
kinetics and of the type of inhibition produced by NADPH is discussed in terms of
the regulation of NAD kinase activity in vivo.

Hydrogen ion changes and contractile behavior in the perfused rat heart.

Cingolani HE, Maas AJ, Zimmerman AN, Meijler FL.

The effect of acid-base alterations was analyzed using isolated rat hearts
perfused at constant coronary perfusion pressure, and stimulated to contract at
constant rat. The amount of shortening in the major axis and its derivative were 
measured to assess myocardial contractility. Both the 'respiratory' and
'metabolic' alterations affected the contractile behavior to the same extent. In 
the physiological range studied by us, acidosis depresses and alkalosis increases
myocardial contraction. However acidosis seems to depress contractility more than
the enhancement produced by the same change in pH towards the alkalotic side.
When either amount of shortening or max dl/dt was plotted as a function of
hydrogen ion acitvity (aH+) a linear correlation was obtained, either with pure
'metabolic' or 'respiratory' acid-base induced alterations (correlation
coefficients higher than -.95; P less than .01). Our findings suggest that in the
range studied by us, contraction of the perfused rat heart following acid-base
alterations, is a linear function of hydrogen ion activity.

Changes of EEG and pulmonary venous admixture during a protein load in patients
with cirrhosis.

Schomerus H, Buchta I, Arndt H.

21 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and 24 control patients were studied
before and after a protein load (120 g protein per day during one week). An EEG
was recorded and a visual assessment of frequency pattern was performed. Venous
admixture was estimated during hyperoxia. According to the EEG frequency pattern 
the patient group with cirrhosis was subdivided into those with EEG slowing after
the protein load (n = 7) and those without (n = 14). The following results were
obtained: 1) Resting arterial blood gases did not change in either group. 2)
There was a significant increase of the AaD02 (difference between alveolar p02
and peripheral arterial p02) in cirrhotics and controls. 3) The increase in AaD02
was significantly larger in those cirrhotics showing EEG slowing compared to
those without EEG - slowing or to the controls. 4) Fractional venous admisture
increased significantly in those cirrhotics showing EEG slowing. There was no
significant change in those patients who did not show EEG changes or in the
controls.

An evaluation of factors affecting the in vitro bioassay for erythropoietin.

Dunn CD, Napier JA.

Two main aspects of the in vitro mouse foetal liver cell assay for Erythroid
Stimulating Factor (ESF) in human sera have been investigated. The haem
extraction process has been shown to give specific and quantitative recovery of
59Fe labelled haem from haemoglobin thus confirming that the material assayed in 
human sera is stimulating the synthesis of this protein. The extraction procedure
can be simplified considerably by prior mixing of the reagents without
significantly influencing the results. Several serum constituents (citrate,
testosterone, B12, folic acid and iron) have been investigated over a range of
concentrations for possible effects on the cultures. Generally only small effects
on haem synthesis were observed. It is concluded that variations in the levels of
these factors in sera from treated patients will not produce any significant
alterations in the estimated ESF concentrations.

[Mechanisms of the thermogenic action of noradrenaline during adaptation to
cold].

[Article in Russian]

Sobolev VI, Pevnyĭ SA.

In white rats both adapted and unadapted to cold, the RQ dynamics during cold
exposure, noradrenaline and ganglion blocking agent administration, were studied.
The adapted animals' RQ in thermoneutral conditions was shown to be a little
higher than in the control rats; 0.5 mg/kg noradrenaline injections induced a
clear RQ decrease in the former and did not influence the latters' RQ. Cold
exposure was followed by a RQ decrease in both. Ganglion blocking agent
administration decreased the RQ in the adapted animals and prevented it from
falling in the control those. Noradrenaline is supposed to be the main but not
the only factor activating lipolysis in the cold adapted animals.

Chromosomal basis of the merozygosity in a partially deploid mutant of
Pneumococcus.

Ledbetter ML, Hotchkiss RD.

A sulfonamide-resistant mutant of pneumococcus, sulr-c, displays a genetic
instability, regularly segregating to wild type. DNA extracts of derivatives of
the strain possess transforming activities for both the mutant and wild-type
alleles, establishing that the strain is a partial diploid. The linkage of sulr-c
to strr-61, a stable chromosomal marker, was established, thus defining a
chromosomal locus for sulr-c. DNA isolated from sulr-c cells transforms two
mutant recipient strains at the same low efficiency as it does a wild-type
recipient, although the mutant property of these strains makes them capable of
integrating classical "low-efficiency" donor markers equally as efficiently as
"high efficiency" markers. Hence sulr-c must have a different basis for its low
efficiency than do classical low efficiency point mutations. We suggest that the 
DNA in the region of the sulr-c mutation has a structural abnormality which leads
both to its frequent segregation during growth and its difficulty in efficiently 
mediating genetic transformation.

Recombination as a requirement for segregation of a partially diploid mutant of
Pneumococcus.

Ledbetter ML, Hotchkiss RD.

Conditions are described in which the pneumococcal mutant strain sulr-c,
resistant to the drug sulfanilamide, gives rise to sensitive segregants resistant
to nitrobenzoic acid at a frequency constant with time. This segregant frequency 
is markedly enhanced upon exposure of the cells to doses of ultraviolet light or 
mitomycin C that permit survival of 50% to 90% of the cells. Treatment with
acridine orange diminishes the segregant frequency. From the known influences of 
these three agents on genetic recombination, we propose that a recombination
event is necessary in the generation of segregants.--During a period of
incubation following treatment with ultraviolet light or mitomycin C, cell
division resumes and the original segregant frequency is restored. Thus potential
segregants are either unable to replicate in the absence of selection, or they
are under-represented among the cells dividing soon after treatment.--If the
sulr-c mutation is introduced into a mutant pneumococcal strain lacking an
ATP-dependent exonuclease activity and deficient in recombination with
transforming DNA, segregant frequencies are unaffected. This fact may indicate
limits upon the type of recombination event responsible for segregation.

Scott BB, Hardy GJ, Losowsky MS.

A patient is reported with mast cell infiltration of the small intestine in the
absence of the skin involvement characteristic of mast cell disease. She also had
subtotal villous atrophy responsive to a gluten-free diet. Criteria for
diagnosing mast cell disease of the small intestine are proposed. The literature 
of small intestinal mast cell disease is reviewed and the relationship to coeliac
disease is discussed.

Gastric pH and microflora of normal and diarrhoeic infants.

Maffei HV, Nóbrega FJ.

The microflora and pH of gastric contents were determined in breast-fed and in
bottle-fed normal infants, in well nourished infants with acute diarrhoea and in 
infants with chronic diarrhoea and protein-calorie malnutrition. The last group
of infants was reevaluated after recovery from diarrhoea and protein-calorie
malnutrition. A bactericidal pH effect below 2-5 was observed. Bottle-fed
controls had low pH values and low bacterial concentrations, whereas infants with
chronic diarrhoea and protein-calorie malnutrition had high pH values and
bacterial overgrowth, essentially of Gram-negative bacilli. After recovery, the
only remaining alteration was the frequent isolation of yeast-like fungi in low
concentrations. Infants with acute diarrhoea, except for the isolation more
frequently of yeast-like fungi, presented no alterations; this seems to indicate 
that pH alterations and Gram-negative bacilli overgrowth occurred during the
evolution of the disease to a chronic state. Breast-fed normal infants had
hydrogen-ion concentrations similar to those of the chronic diarrhoea group, but 
without Gram-negative bacilli overgrowth, suggesting that other factors, besides 
pH, regulate bacterial growth in the gastric contents of these groups of infants.

[Biphasic (ulcer-forming and ulcer-preventing) effect of adrenaline in rats].

[Article in Japanese]

Dozaki T, Imai K, Mizukami S.

Adrenaline-induced gastric ulceration was studied in rats. Adrenaline in high
doses caused gastric ulcer, which was completely blocked by pretreatment with
alpha-blockers (phenoxybenzamine, dibenamine), but not by pretreatment with
propranolol or atropine, nor by vagotomy, hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy. After 
successive administration of adrenaline, once daily for 7 days, however, no
gastric ulcer was observed. Recovery from the ulcerogenic action of adrenaline
was seen after 4 weeks withdrawal. Pretreatment with a small dose of adrenaline
inhibited the ulcerogenic action of a high dose of adrenaline. Pretreatment with 
reserpine, pyrogallol or iproniazid inhibited the action of adrenaline. It is
concluded that adrenaline has a biphasic effect on gastric ulceration, the
ulcerogenic action is due to its alpha-action and antiulcerogenic effect is due
to development of tachyphylaxis.

[Comparison of drug effects on the isolated rat colon and duodenum].

[Article in Japanese]

Koshiba H.

Adrenaline and isoproterenol elicited nearly maximal relaxation of the colon even
in small doses, whereas increase in the doses caused greater relaxation in the
duodenum. In the colon, these drugs prevented, to a great extent the contraction 
induced by acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin but in the duodenum were totally
ineffective. Dibenamine and propranolol reduced adrenaline- and
isoproterenol-induced relaxation in the duodenum, though propranolol decreased
the relaxation caused by isoproterenol. Atropine prevented ACh-induced
contraction in both the colon and duodenum in the same way. After 2-bromolysergic
acid diethylamide, duodenal contraction caused by ACh or serotonin decreased by
over 70%; however, the contraction of the colon was not significantly inhibited. 
Methysergide had similar effects, but to a lesser degree. In calcium-free bathing
fluid without addition of Na2EDTA, ACh and prostaglandin E1 elicited contraction 
in the colon, but not in the duodenum.

[Monoamine oxidase (XXXVI). Characteristics of benzylamine oxidase in the dog
serum].

[Article in Japanese]

Fukushima T.

Enzymic properties of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in dog serum were studied and the
following results were obtained. Some of enzymic properties of MAO in dog serum
differed from that of mitochondrial MAO. When dog serum was fractionated by
ammonium sulfate, proteins were concentrated in two fractions, such as 25
approximately 33% and 67 approximately 80% of saturated ammonium sulfate
fraction, while MAO activity was concentrated in 40 approximately 50% of
saturated ammonium sulfate fraction. The reaction rate of MAO in dog serum was
found to be proportional to enzyme concentration. The optimum pH of MAO in dog
serum was 7.0 which differed from that of MAO in rabbit serum (pH 8.0). Tris-HCl 
buffer strongly inhibited MAO activity in dog serum. When benzylamine was used as
substrate, the highest activity was obtained compared with the other substrate
used. The activities with butylamine, amylamine, beta-phenylethylamine and
tyramine showed about 30% while tryptamine and serotonin showed 3 approximately
10% compared to that with benzymlamine as substrate. The value of pI50 of catron 
was about 3 X 10(-6) M and that of harmaline was about 3 X 10(-5) M, but
pargyline did not inhibit MAO activity in dog serum at the concentration of 1 X
10(-4) M.

[Combined use of bucolome and pyrazolone derivatives (1). Pharmacological
activities and blood concentration].

[Article in Japanese]

Nozaki M.

A combination of two or more drugs may exert a drug-drug interaction, in which
case the effect can be potentiated or antagonized. Such synergistic effects are
well known in the case of pyrabital (barbital + aminopyrine) or irgapyrine
(phenylbutazone + aminopyrine). Bucolome (BCP), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
agent, has the chemical structure of a barbiturate and also resembles the formula
of pheylbutazone. Thus the influence of BCP combination on the pharmacological
activities of various pyrazolone derivatives was examined. BCP potentiated the
analgesic and antipyretic effects of 4-aminoantipyrine (4A),
methylaminoantipyrine (MA), aminopyrine (AM) and isopropylaminoantipyrine (IPA), 
which were substituted by the alkylamino group at 4-position of the pyrazolone
ring. This potentiation occurred when the dose of BCP exceeded that of the
pyrazolones, and was especially marked when combination ratio of BCP exceeded
that of the pyrazolones, and was especially marked when combination ratio of BCP 
and pyrazolone was 2:1 mola. The analgesic effects of antipyrine (AN),
isopropylantipyrine (IP) and aminopropylone (AP), which were substituted by alkyl
group or aminoacylamino group at 4-position, were not potentiated by BCP in any
combination ratio. Most pyrazolones showed additive acute toxicity in their
combination with BCP, but acute toxicities of 4A and AM, which were potentiated
in analgesic effects, were decreased and antagonized when combined with BCP. The 
plasma concentration of AM was increased and prolonged by BCP, while that of IP
remained much the same. These results suggest that the pharmacological activities
are associated with certain molecular interactions between BCP and pyrazolones,
which are substituted by the alkylamino group at 4-position of the pyrazolone
ring.

[Combined use of bucolome and pyrazolone derivatives (II). Complex formation due 
to interaction between bucolome and pyrazolones].

[Article in Japanese]

Nozaki M.

We have already reported that bucolome (BCP), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
agent, potentiates significantly the analgesic and antipyretic effects of
pyrazolones which are substituted by alkylamino group at 4-position of the
pyrazolone ring. Physical and quantum chemistry were applied to the mechanism of 
this synergistic action. The solubility of BCP was markedly increased in
proportion to elevation of aminopyrine (AM) concentration, but not by a
combination with isopropylantipyrine (IP). The binding of BCP to bovine serum
albumin was slightly inhibited by AM, but not by IP. The mixture of AM and BCP in
aqueous media generated optical absorption in the ultraviolet differential
spectrum, due to the charge transfer interaction. The results of the infrared or 
NMR spectrum demonstrated the formation of a hydrogen binding in non-aqueous
media between BCP and AM. From the calculation of the charge on an atom, the
energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the frontier electron
density, BCP is considered to be a good electron acceptor. The beta-units of Mho 
of pyrazolones were found to correlate with the potentiation coefficient of
analgesic activity in combination drugs. These results suggest that the complex
formation between BCP and pyrazolones is an important factor for the synergism of
action and is due to the charge transfer interaction and the hydrogen binding of 
both molecules.

Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase activity of Rhizobium species.

Siddiqui KA, Banerjee AK.

FDP aldolase was found to be present in the cell-free extracts of Rhizobium
leguminosarum, Rhizobium phaseoli, Rhizobium trifolii, Rhizobium meliloti,
Rhizobium lupini, Rhizobium japonicum and Rhizobium species from Arachis hypogaea
and Sesbania cannabina. The enzyme in 3 representative species has optimal
activity at pH 8.4 in 0.2M veronal buffer. The enzyme activity was completely
lost by treatment at 60 degrees C for 15 min. The Km values were in the range
from 2.38 to 4.55 X 10(-6)M FDP. Metal chelating agents inhibited enzyme
activity, but monovalent or bivalent metal ions failed to stimulate the activity.
Bivalent metal ions in general were rather inhibitory.

Prevention of cell agglutination and competence in a genetically transformable
strain of Pneumococcus by D-glucosamine and D-galactosamine.

Kohoutová M.

In the presence of amino sugars D-glucosamine and D-galactosamine no spontaneous 
competence could be observed in the highly transformable R6bd strain of
Pneumococcus or it was decreased by several orders of magnitude. The highest
inhibition of competence was detected when the amino sugar at a concentration 5
mg/ml of the medium was added not only to the transformation but also to the
pretransformation medium. After a 150 min growth in the transformation medium in 
the presence of the amino sugar a 3--4-fold greater number of cells (as a viable 
count) could be detected as compared with the control without the amino sugar. It
was found microscopically that the amino sugar prevents natural agglutination,
which normally occurs in the competent culture. The role of specific amino sugar 
determinants for binding of the competence factor on the cell surface and the
resulting inhibitory effect of these sugars on the development of competence are 
discussed.

Effect of some aldoses on growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae inhibited with
molybdenum.

Zemek J, Bílik V, Zákutná L.

The inhibitory effect of molybdenum ions on growth of yeasts at pH 5.5 was found 
to be decreased by aldoses in the following order: D-talose greater than
L-mannose greater than L-ribose greater than D-lyxose greater than L-galactose
greater than L-arabinose greater than L-glucose greater than L-xylose. Increased 
concentrations of molybdenum brought about morphological changes of yeast cells. 
Cells grown under these conditions were smaller, had thicker walls and formed
clusters.

Transport properties of membrane vesicles from Acholeplasma laidlawii. II.
Kinetic characteristics and specificity of glucose transport system.

Panchenko LF, Fedotov NS, Tarshis MA.

The glucose transport system of membrane vesicles isolated from Acholeplasma
laidlawii is saturable, with a Km of 21.2 mum and V of 0.68 nmol min-1 (mg
protein)-1. The process is pH-dependent and a break occurs in the Arrhenius plot 
at 15 degrees C. Exogenous substrates did not stimulate glucose transport
probably due to their inability to penetrate into membrane vesicles.
3-O-Methylglucose and 6-deoxyglucose competitively inhibited glucose transport.
Maltose inhibited transport of glucose noncompetitively. These sugars also
elicited glucose efflux from preloaded membrane vesicles.

Transport of 4-deoxy- and 6-deoxy-D-glucose in baker's yeast.

Kotyk A, Michaljanicová D, Veres K, Soukupová V.

Tritium-labelled 4-deoxy-D-glucose (4-dglc) and 6-deoxy-D-glucose (6-dgcl) were
prepared by catalytic hydrogenolysis of the corresponding deoxyiodo derivatives
with gaseous tritium. The two sugars are transported into Saccharomyces
cerevisiae by both the constitutive glucose and the inducible galactose carrier. 
Uranyl ions are powerful inhibitors. The pH optimum in uninduced cells lies at
5.5 for both sugars, the apparent activation energies (between 15 and 35 degrees 
C) are 25.1 kJ/mol and 16.5 kJ/mol, respectively. The steady-state intracellular 
concentration of both sugars is less than the extracellular one (no uphill
transport). Neither of them is a substrate of yeast hexokinase. 4-Deoxy-D-glucose
undergoes a dinitrophenol-sensitive conversion to an unknown metabolite which is 
not phosphorylated and may represent one of its oxidation products.

Gluconic acid production by Penicillium puberulum.

Elnaghy MA, Megalla SE.

Twenty-five Penicillium species isolated from Egyptian soil were examined for
their ability to produce gluconic acid in surface culture. Of the eight species
capable of producing gluconic acid, Penicillium puberulum gave the maximum yield 
(91% gluconic acid from glucose after 7 days of fermentation with 3% CaCO3).
Peptone was the best nitrogen source for acid fermentation and glucose was
superior to sucrose. Addition of low concentrations of KH2PO4 and MgSO4 - 7 H2O
stimulated acid production. An initial pH of 6.1 was most favourable for acid
accumulation and addition of CaCO3 was necessary for maximum acid production.

A simple method of isolation and purification of cultures of wood-rotting fungi.

Ginterová A, Janotková O.

A simple method of isolation and purification of cultures of higher fungi, mainly
wood-rotting fungi, without special requirements for the presence of
nitrogencontaining nutrients is described. Parts of fruiting bodies, spores or
infected wood is inoculated on Petri dishes with an agar medium of the following 
composition: 1.0 g KH2PO4, 0.2 g MgSO4 - 7 H2O, 0.1 g caSO4, 0.01 g Fe2(SO4)3,
10.0 g glucose, tap water to 1 litre; 20.0 g agar. This medium does not suit most
of the contaminants but fungal hyphae overgrow the whole surface of the dish so
that a purified culture can be obtained from parts distant from the inoculation
site.

[Studies on low volume priming heart lung bypass (author's transl)].

[Article in Japanese]

Kawamura M.

This report concerns the feasibility of low volume priming extracorporeal
circulation. Through this study, the bubble oxygenator with Zuhdi's heat exchange
was used. Moderate hypothermia with surface cooling and hemodilution perfusion
with 5 per cent D/W was evaluated in 32 mongrel dogs and 16 clinical open heart
cases. The results obtained here were as follow: 1) Body temperature reduction by
surface cooling before bypass provided more even cooling than did core cooling by
low flow partial bypass alone. 2) In regard to cardiac loading on returning the
whole perfusate of the circuit to patient, approximately 20 ml/kg of 5 per cent
D/W was feasible as a priming solution. 3) To reduce the blood visicosity,
hemodilution technique with 5 per cent D/W was superior, and hemodilution effect 
during postoperative periods was temporaly. 4) The excess lactate volume
postulated by Huckabee was a available index to evaluate metabolic acidosis
during the extracorporeal circulation. 5) With aid of surface cooling, the
acid-base balance during perfusion was kept to lesser extent than that of core
cooling only. 6) This study indicated that the low priming perfusion in
conjunction with surface cooling hypothermia was a reliable technique for the
open heart operation and may be applied in more prolonged perfusion.

[Studies on extracorporeal circulation with large volume hemodilution using
lactate ringer's solution and low molecular weight dextran: alterations of
acid-base balance associated with intentional hemodilution (author's transl)].

[Article in Japanese]

Yamada T.

Twenty mongrel dogs, weighing between 7.5 and 13.0 kg were used to investigate
the percentage limits permissible for hemodilution using a double-helical
reservoir heart-lung machine which has a 1,100 ml of priming volume. In both 40
and 50 per cent groups of intentional hemodilution by 30 minute extracorporeal
circulation, remarkable anemia was inevitable and recovery was extremely slow,
especially in the 50 per cent dilution group. In both 40 and 50 per cent groups
of intentional hemodilutions by 30 minute extracorporeal circulation, metabolic
acidosis was observed. In 50 per cent group of intentional hemodilution, no
improvement of metabolic acidosis was observed even after perfusion. When sodium 
bicarbonate was administered to 40 per cent hemodilution group, minimum
alterations of acid-base balance and of serum electrolytes were observed during
and after extracorporeal perfusion. When sodium bicarbonate was administered to
50 per cent hemodilution group, metabolic acidosis was more evident than in 40
per cent hemodilution group accompanied with an increase in serum sodium
concentration and a decrease in serum chloride concentration. These data qualify 
the use of 40 per cent intentional hemodilution using Lactate Ringer's solution
or low molecular weight dextran for 30 minute extracorporeal circulation when
sodium bicarbonate is administered in adequate amounts.

Purification and characterization of phosphodiesterase from Crotalus venom.

Philipps GR.

A procedure for the purification of phosphodiesterase from Crotalus venom on
DEAE-cellulose at alkaline pH is described. The enzyme gives a single band in
polyacrylamide gels and is free of contaminating nucleolytic enzymes. The
molecular weight is about 115000. Concentration in an Amicon ultrafiltrator gave 
a highly concentrated active enzyme. Phosphodiesterase is relatively stable and
can be stored at 4 degrees C in the presence of Mg2 and serum albumin for years. 
For the detection of contaminating endonuclease, an assay was used in which tRNA 
was the substrate and possible internal breaks were detected in polyacrylamide
gel after denaturation. With bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate as substrate, 15mM Mg2 
was necessary for optimal activity. The reaction remained linear for at least 15 
min at 22 degrees C. At 45 degrees C, the liberation of p-nitrophenol was highest
within 25 min of incubation. At 75 degrees C, inactivation of the enzyme occurred
after 4 min.

Limited hydrolysis of tRNA by phosphodiesterase.

Philipps GR, Chiemprasert T.

Digestion of tRNA by electrophoretically pure phosphodiesterase is limited to a
short sequence of nucleotides at the 3'-terminus. On the average, four percent of
all nucleotides can be released from tRNA. The optimum Mg2 concentration is 10mM 
and the optimum pH 9.2. The mode of action is a random attack by the enzyme on
the substrate. The terminal AMP is completely removed at 15 degrees C after short
incubation; about 400 mol of AMP were removed per min by 1 mol of enzyme. The
following CMP residues are released much more slowly; at 15 degrees C
incompletely, and at 37 degrees C more or less completely in 1 h. In about 50% of
the tRNA molecules, the fourth nucleotide could be removed in very long
incubations or with very high enzyme concentrations.

Ecdysone Oxidase, an enzyme from the blowfly Calliphora erythrocephala (Meigen).

Koolman J, Karlson P.

In the blowfly, the formation of 3-dehydroecdysone from the insect molting
hormone ecdysone is catalyzed by an enzyme which carries hydrogen from ecdysone
and ecdysterone to oxygen. The enzyme is therefore called "ecdysone oxidase". Two
methods are described for the detection of ecdysone oxidase activity, one using a
radiolabelled substrate which is separated from the product by thin-layer
chromatography after the reaction, and the other using dichloroindophenol, which 
is discoloured by the redox reaction. The ecdysone oxidase is purified by a
factor of 2200 from prepupae of Calliphora erythrocephala using salt
precipitation and ion exchange chromatography. The ecdysone oxidase has a Km
value for ecdysone of 42muM. The pH optimum is 6.5. The temperature optimum lies 
at 45 degrees C. The ecdysone oxidase has a molecular weight of 240000.

Using a hospital for desensitization of an outpatient's illness-related fears.

Powers PS, Powers HP.

An outpatient with phobias related to enclosed places, hospitals, doctors, and
cancer was treated by systematic desensitization; the facilities of a general
hospital were used for part of the process. Steps in treatment included securing 
a complete psychiatric and social history, teaching the patient relaxation
therapy techniques, and establishing a hierarchy of anxiety-provoking stimuli
specifically related to the patient's fears. After desensitization the patient
was able to enter the hospital for tests for a physical ailment and showed a
general decrease in her fears.

Analysis of immunosuppression generated by the graft-versus-host reaction. I. A
suppressor T-cell component studied in vivo.

Shand FL.

The kinetics and cellular characteristics of immunosuppression in (CBA-p X
C57/Bl)F1 mice during graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction induced with spleen cells 
from either parental strain have been investigated. Effects on PFC responses to
thymus-dependent (chicken red blood cells) and independent (levan) antigens have 
been compared. The unresponsive state which developed in GVH mice was expressed
to comparable extent by their spleen cells following transfer to irradiated
recipients. Furthermore, GVH spleen cells suppressed normal spleen cells in a
mixed transfer system, but this effect was lost completely by day 21 whereas the 
original donors (or their cells) were still totally refractory after 80 days.
This active suppressor effect was found to be mediated by T cells of perental
origin based on cell fractionation analysis and selective deletion of donor or
host cells by alloimmune attack. The delayed transfer of GVH cells to irradiated 
repopulated recipients challenged with antigen, indicated that suppressor T cells
exert an anti-mitotic influence on antigen-stimulated B-cell proliferation.
Supplementation of macrophage-depleted, anti-theta-treated GVH spleen cells with 
purified normal T cells demonstrated that B cells in GVH mice are normally
reactive even when active suppression by T cells is no longer demonstrable. The
likelihood that this later phase of immunosuppression is attributable to another 
mechanism is discussed.

Pneumococcal type-associated variability in alternate complement pathway
activation.

Fine DP.

Opsonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae may be mediated by the alternate
complement pathway. To study the importance of this interaction to human disease,
complement consumption by pneumococci of various serotypes was measured in humwn 
serum chelated with ethyleneglycoltraacetic acid, a substance that blocks the
classic but not the alternate complement pathwway. Serotype I, in contrast to all
other types studied, lacked ability to consume complement in this system. The
ability for serotypes III, IV, and VIII to activate the alternate pathway could
be eliminated by prior serum absorption at O C with they type in question, a
condition that would remove antibody but not complement. Types VII, XII, XIV, and
XXV readily activated the alternate pathway in unabsorbed and absorbed sera.
Differences could not be related to properties of the capsules. It was concluded 
that types I, III, IV, and VIII lack intrinsic ability to activate and thus be
opsonized by the alternate complement pathway, although types III, IV, and VIII
can do so in concert with specific antibody. The fact that these same types are
especially prominent in human disease suggests that the ability to evade
opsonization by the alternate complement pathway in pre-antibody phases of
infection may be a virulence factor in pneumococci.

Conditions for production, and some characteristics, of mycobacterial growth
inhibitory factor produced by spleen cells from mice immunized with viable cells 
of the attenuated H37Ra strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Cahall DL, Youmans GP.

Mycobacterial growth inhibitory factor (MycoIF), found in supernatant fluids of
mouse spleen cell cultures that have been stimulated in vitro with homologous
antigen, inhibited the intracellular multiplication of virulent tubercle bacilli 
within normal mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Antigenically stimulated
H37Ra-immunized mouse spleen cells required 72 h of incubation to produce
supernatant fluids that would cause intracellular inhibition. Supernatant fluids 
from 48-h mouse spleen cell cultures were not able to produce intracellular
inhibition. Investigation of the culture conditions showed that at lease 1.0%
human serum was required in the tissue culture medium for the production of
MycoIF by spleen cells from immunized mice. MycoIF activity was noted only in
supernatant fluids from spleen cell cultures incubated with antigen for 72 h.
MycoIF was nondialyzable and unaffected by freezing, lyophilization, or
incubation at 60 C for 30 min. However, MycoIF was inactivated after incubation
at 80 C for 30 min. MycoIF was unaffected by low hydrogen ion concentrations (pH 
7 to 12), but exposure to higher hydrogen ion concentrations (pH 6, pH 5)
significantly decrease MycoIF activity, and exposure to pH 4 to 2 abolished all
activity. Supernatant fluids diluted 1:32 were still able to produce significant 
intracellular inhibition of growth of virulent tubercle bacilli.

Effect of pneumococci on blood clotting, platelets, and polymorphonuclear
leukocytes.

Guckian JC.

Infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and products from the organism have
been associated with alterations in blood clotting and function of platelets.
Pneumococci and pneumococcal polysaccharide shortened the clotting times of whole
blood, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) in vitro.
Clotting times of PPP and PRP from C6-deficient animals were likewise decreased. 
The bacteria had no effect on the one-stage prothrombin time or the partial
thromboplastin time when the organisms were used as activating agents. Platelets 
aggregated in the presence of pneumococci, but aggregation was prevented by the
addition of cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP). Furthermore, cAMP
corrected the shortened clotting time of PRP in the presence of pneumococci. The 
clumping and release of polymorphonuclear coagulant that was induced by
pneumococci was not prevented by cAMP. Thus, pneumococci exert several
dose-dependent thromboplastic effects: (i) release of platelet thromboplastic
substances; (ii) a direct thromboplastic effect; and (iii) release of
polymorphonuclear coagulant.

Some properties of a D-alanine carboxypeptidase in envelope fractions of
Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

Davis RH, Salton MR.

Envelope preparations of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain GC1 (a stable, piliated
strain of intermediate colony morphology) and type T1 possess a D-alanine
carboxypeptidase which releases the terminal alanine residue from the uridine
5'-diphosphate-N-acetyl muramylpentapeptide substrate (isolated from Bacillus
cereus T). The D-alanine carboxypeptidase of the GC1 envelopes has a broad pH
optimum between pH 8.0 to 10.0. When the molarity of the
tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer was varied, the activity showed an optimum
over the range 0.2 to 0.4 M. Activity was higher (135% of control level) when 20 
to 80 mM Mg2+ was present. The Km for the enzyme was 0.25 mM. The D-alanine
carboxypeptidase was inhibited by several beta-lactam antibiotics and the 50%
inhibitory levels were 10(-8) M penicillin G, 10(-8) M ampicillin, 10(-5) M
cloxacillin, and 5 x 10(-7) M methicillin.

Phenomenon of hot-cold hemolysis: chelator-induced lysis of
sphingomyelinase-treated erythrocytes.

Smyth CJ, Möllby R, Wadström T.

Staphylococcus aureus produces a phospholipase C specific for sphingomyelin
(beta-hemolysin). Erythrocytes with approximately 50% sphingomyelin in their
membranes, e.g., from sheep, have been shown to have up to 60% of this
phospholipid hydrolyzed by this enzyme at 37 C in isotonic buffered saline
without hemolysis. Cooling of sphingomyelinase C-treated erythrocytes to 4 C
causes complete lysis of the cells, a phenomenon known as hot-cold hemolysis. The
addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) to sheep erythrocytes preincubated
with sphingomyelinase C was found to induce rapid hemolysis at 37 C. The treated 
cells became susceptible to chelator-induced hemolysis and to hot-cold hemolysis 
simultaneously, and the degree of lysis of both mechanisms increased equally with
prolonged preincubation with sphingomyelinase C. Erythrocytes of species not
readily susceptible to hot-cold hemolysis were equally insusceptible to
chelator-induced lysis. Chelators of the EDTA series were the most effective,
whereas chelators more specific for Ca2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, and Mg2+ were without
effect. The rate of chelator-induced lysis was dependent on the preincubation
period with beta-hemolysin and on the concentration of chelator added. The
optimal concentration of EDTA was found to equal the amount of exogenously added 
Mg2+, a cation necessary for sphingomyelinase C activity. Hypotonicity increased 
the rate of chelator-induced hemolysis, whereas increasing the osmotic pressure
to twice isotonic completely inhibited chelator-induced lysis. The data suggest
that exogenously added and/or membrane-bound divalent cations are important for
the stability of sphingomyelin-depleted membranes. The phenomenon of hot-cold
hemolysis may be a consequence of the temperature dependence of divalent ion
stabilization.

Host defense against the pneumococcus in T-lymphocyte-deficient, nude mice.

Winkelstein JA, Swift AJ.

Resistance to pneumococcal infection was tested in T-lymphocyte-deficient, nude
(nu/nu) mice. Pneumococcal serum opsonizing activity, in vivo phagocytosis of the
pneumococcus, and the mean lethal dose for the pneumococcus were all found to be 
the same in nude mice as in control (+/+) mice. T-lymphocytes do not appear to
play a significant role in the host's defense against the pneumococcus.

In vitro antagonism of the mediators of allergy by a benzopyrano-benzopyran
carboxylic acid PR-D-92-EA.

Possanza GJ, Bauen A, Stewart PB.

PR-D-92-EA was tested on isolated guinea pig ileum and rat stomach strips for
activity against mediators probably released after allergen antibody union. It
antagonized the response produced by histamine, bradykinin, serotonin,
prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2ALPHA and slow-reacting substance of
anaphylaxis (SRS-A). The concentrations which blocked 50% of the response were
150, 145, 92, 70, 47, and 32 mug/ml, respectively. This compound may be useful in
the treatment of allergic conditions.

Tyrosine aminotransferase induction in normal and tumor-bearing chickens.

Horváth I, Arányi P, Náray A, Földes I, Gyuris A.

Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) induction by glucagon and dexamethasone in the
liver of tumor-bearing chickens was studied and compared with induction in
healthy animals. The transplantable tumor was caused by inoculation of cells from
a cell line induced by MC29 avian leukosis virus. TAT was hardly detectable in
tumor tissue of control and dexamethasone-treated chickens, but it was induced by
glucagon to levels which were significant although very low when compared to
those in host liver or the liver of non-tumor-bearing controls after glucagon
treatment. Dexamethasone failed to induce TAT in host liver at 8 A.M. while it
significantly indiced TAT in the normal liver at the same time of the day.
Similar failure of TAT induction was not detectable when glucagon was used
instead of dexamethasone. Furthermore, it was found that diurnal variations in
basal and dexamethasone or glucagon-induced TAT levels are considerably mitigated
in host liver as compared to those observed in the liver of healthy animals. The 
possible reasons for these findings are discussed.

A behavior modification training program for staff working with drug addicts.

Cheek FE, Tomarchio T, Burtle V, Moss H, McConnell D.

This paper described a Behavior Modification Training Program, emphasizing
self-control, for staff working with drug addicts. The program, which is
primarily geared toward the training of paraprofessionals, takes place in ten
1-1/2 hour sessions and includes an overview of behavior modification as well as 
instruction in techniques of relaxation, desensitization, self-image improvement,
behavior analysis, behavior control, assertive training, rational thinking, and
how to set up and run similar behavior modification training programs for staff
and patients. Since this training began at the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric
Institute in November 1971, a total of 898 staff members, mostly
paraprofessionals working with addicts, alcoholics, mentally ill patients, and
inmates, including 53 from our own institution, 576 persons from other facilities
in New Jersey, and 269 from facilities in other states, have been trained, while 
2,021 patients have been trained in similar programs. Most of this training has
been accomplished by paraprofessionals. Preliminary evaluation data have been
promising and the response of participants enthusiastic.

A kinetic study of the hydrolysis of N-acetyl dehydroalanine methyl ester.

Snow JT, Finley JW, Friedman M.

Hydrolysis rates of N-acetyl dehydroalanine methyl ester (methyl
2-acetamidoacrylate) and related model compounds were measured in aqueous,
organic and mixed aqueous media. Adding dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to water,
retarded hydrolysis of the ester by a factor of 2 to 500, depending on the pH of 
the medium and concentration of DMSO. Ethanol also slowed hydrolysis, but the
effect was not so pronounced. Related studies show that the acetamido group C-N
bond of sodium 2-acetamido-acrylate is hydrolyzed only about 1/130 as fast as the
ester group C-O bond. Aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide should by a useful medium for
synthesis of peptide, amino acid and protein derivatives of N-acetyl
dehydroalanine methyl ester.

The ophthalmologist's office: planning and practice. Patient traffic flow and use
of paramedical personnel.

Byron HM.

In order for the ophthalmologist to achieve the greatest earning power and
personal satisfaction, he or she must devise traffic flow techniques that
efficiently allow for maximum utilization of all examining areas and paramedical 
personnel in the office without dehumanizing patients. By delegating as much
responsibility as possible to staff, the ophthalmologist will have the
opportunity of performing his or her specialized skills to the fullest extent,
and therefore will achieve optimal personal gratification. This emotional reward 
indemnifies the future of private practice, because it can exist only in the
presence of a close patient-physician relationship, which is the cornerstone of
the private practice of ophthalmology.

Computer evaluation of the effect of urecholine on the spontaneous activity of
smooth muscle from the urinary bladder of the rabbit.

Keyser GF, Boyarsky S, Labay P.

The spontaneous activity exhibited in vitro by smooth muscle strips from the
urinary bladder of the rabbit under the influence of Urecholine in concentrations
from 0.3 to 30 muM has been characterized in terms of three parameters: mean
tension, frequency of contraction, and contractile deviation, all obtained by
computer an alysis. While mean tension and frequency monotonically increased with
concentration, the contractile deviation rose to a peak in the vicinity of 3.0 to
6.0 muM and thereafter decreased. At concentrations less than 10 muM the
contractile patterns were almost periodic, while at 10 and 30 muM, the patterns
became highly erratic. Histologic examination of a limited number of tissues
showed longitudinally oriented muscle bundles with multiple anastomosing.

Characteristics of the non-occluded form of a nuclear polyhedrosis virus.

Dougherty EM, Vaughn JL, Reichelderfer CF.

Non-occluded virions of a nuclear polyhedrosis virus of the alfalfa looper,
Autographa californica, found in the medium of cell cultures of infected fall
armyworm, Spodopter frugiperda, and in the hemolymph of infected S. frugiperda
larvae were partially characterized by biological, chemical and physical methods.
Also, the rate of appearance of the virions was studied in cell culture and the
host insect to determine maximum virion production. Virions obtained from both
sources were heat-sensitive, acid-labile and inactivated by several organic
solvents. The non-occluded virions found in the insect cell culture fluid and in 
the hemolymph were identical, and both were enveloped nucleocapsids.
Visualization of the fragilely enveloped nucleocapsid was accomplished only after
fixation with glutaraldehyde. Differences between the non-occluded and occluded
virions of nuclear polyhedrosis viruses are discussed.

Degradation of myxovirus virion RNA by periodate.

Tannock GA, Griffith IP.

Extensively degraded RNA was isolated from virions of influenza virus which had
been oxidized with sodium m-periodate. Similarly, although to a lesser extent,
RNA isolated from periodate-treated ribonucleoprotein of influenza virus was also
degraded. In contrast, influenza virus RNA, if first freed from other virion
components, was not degraded by periodate oxidation.

Failure of rubella virus to replicate in mosquitos.

Tesh RB, Rosen L.

Rubella virus failed to replicate in mosquitoes (Aedes albopictus and Culex
fatigans) following parenteral inoculation. The virus demonstrated in mosquitoes 
tested immediately after inoculation but was not detected in insects sampled 7,
14 and 21 days postinoculation. This experiment provides further evidence that
rubella is not an arbovirus, but does not invalidate its classification as a
togavirus.

Treatment of severe hypertension with minoxidil.

Traub YM, Redmond DP, Rosenfeld JB, McDonald RH Jr, Shapiro AP.

Minoxidil in daily doses of 6 to 40 mg was administered to 11 patients with
severe hypertension. Two patients died of causes unrelated to the drug and one
patient withdrew from the study. Blood pressure was controlled in the remaining
eight subjects, who received the drug for periods ranging from 5 to 40 months. In
three patients minoxidil could subsequently be replaced by conventional
antihypertensive therapy. Adverse effects of minoxidil included fluid retention
(as assessed by edema and plasma volume studies), nonspecific ECG changes,
hypertrichosis and conjunctival redness. Concomitant administration of diuretic
and beta-adrenergic blocking agents resulted in excellent tolerance of the
treatment and high patient compliance.

Acute renal failure.

Freedman P, Smith EC.

Acute renal failure is a life-threatening situation for which satisfactory
treatment is currently available. Death is usually related to concomitant
infection rather than uremia. Prompt recognition and treatment of underlying
factors that predispose to renal insufficiency can frequently prevent the
development of intrinsic acute renal failure.

Local control of pulmonary resistance and lung compliance in the canine lung.

Coon RL, Rattenborg CC, Kampine JP.

Local control of pulmonary resistance and lung compliance was studied in the in
situ left lower lobe of the canine lung. Recirculation of blood through the lobe 
while the Pco2 of the ventilatory gas was varied resulted in an increase in
resistance and a decrease in compliance only when the pulmonary venous pH was
greater than 7.42. Alternating sodium bicarbonate and lactic acid infusion while 
alveolar Pco2 was maintained below 5 mmHg demonstrated the dependence of the
hypocapnic response on the acid-base status of the blood perfusing the
respiratory airways. The increase in resistance and decrease in compliance
observed at a pulmonary venous pH of 7.64 was comparable to that observed after
lobar pulmonary artery occlusion. Varying degrees of hypoxia did not
significantly affect bronchomotor tone, nor was the bronchoconstriction following
lobar pulmonary artery occlusion affected by the hypoxia. Vagal stimulation
superimposed on a stepwise increase in pulmonary venous pH from 7.32 to 7.62
resulted in an increase in resistance which paralleled the increase in resistance
when pulmonary venous pH alone was increased. Compliance was not significantly
affected by vagal stimulation at any level of pulmonary venous pH.

Analysis of pesticides by chemical derivatization. I. a new procedure for the
formation of 2-chloroethyl esters of ten herbicidal acids.

Chau AS, Terry K.

A new esterification procedure was developed to form 2-chloroethyl esters for 10 
common herbicidal acids, using dicyclohexyl carbodiimide and 2-chloroethanol.
This reagent was found to be more desirable than the commonly used boron
trichloride/2-chloroethanol reagent. Maximum esterification was given for
picloram at a lower reaction temperature with a shorter reaction time. Also,
maximum esterification of dicamba and 2,3,6-TBA was achieved. The boron
trichloride/2-chlorethanol gave poor or little esterification with these 2 acids 
under the various conditions investigated. The effect of solvents on
esterification with the 2 reagents was also explored.

Inactivation of citrate lyase from Rhodopseudomonas gelatinosa by a specific
deacetylase and inhibition of this inactivation by L-(+1-glutamate.

Giffhorn F, Gottschalk G.

A previously unrecognized enzyme, citrate lyase deacetylase, has been purified
about 140-fold from cell extracts of Rhodopseudomonas gelatinosa. It catalyzed
the conversion of enzymatically active acetyl-S-citrate lyase into the inactive
HS-form and acetate. The enzyme exhibited an optimal rate of inactivation at pH
8.1. Because of the instability of acetyl-S-citrate lyase at acidic and alkaline 
pH values, all assays were carried out at pH 7.2, where the spontaneous
hydrolysis of the acetyl-S-citrate lyase was negligible and deacetylase showed
70% of the activity at pH 8.1. The apparent Km value for citrate lyase was 10(-7)
M at pH 7.2 and 30 C. The activity of the deacetylase was restricted to the
citrate lyase from R. gelatinosa. The corresponding lyases from Enterobacter
aerogenes (formerly Klebsiella aerogenes) and Streptococcus diacetilactis were
not deacetylated; likewise, thioesters such as acetyl-S coenzyme A, acetoacetyl-S
coenzyme A, and N-acetyl-S-acetyl-cysteamine were also not hydrolyzed. Citrate
lyase deacetylase was present in very small amounts in cells of R. gelatinosa
grown with acetate or succinate; it was induced by citrate along with the citrate
lyase. L-(+)-Glutamate strongly inhibited the deacetylase. Fifty percent
inhibition was obtained at a concentration of 1.4 X 10(-4) L-(+)-glutamate.
D-(-)-Glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate, L-alpha-hydroxyglutarate, L-(-)-proline,
and other metabolites were less effective.

Novel type of murein transglycosylase in Escherichia coli.

Höltje JV, Mirelman D, Sharon N, Schwarz U.

The purification and properties of a novel type of murein transglycosylase from
Escherichia coli are described. The purified enzyme appears as a single band on
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and has an apparent molecular weight
of approximately 65,000 as estimated by gel filtration and gel electrophoresis.
It degrades pure murein sacculi from E. coli almost completely into
low-molecular-weight products. The two prominent muropeptide fragments in the
digest are the disaccharide-tripeptide N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic
acid-L-alanine-D-iso-glutamic acid-meso-diaminopimelic acid and the corresponding
disaccharide-tetrapeptide N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic
acid-L-alanine-D-iso-glutamic acid-meso-diaminopimelic acid-D-alanine. The unique
feature of these compounds is that the disaccharide has no reducing end group and
that the muramic acid residue possesses an internal 1 leads to 6 anhydro linkage.
The new lytic enzyme is designated as a murein: murein transglycosylase. Its
possible role in the rearrangement of murein during cell growth and division is
discussed.

Formation and cleavage of 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate by 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate
aldolase of Aspergillus niger.

Allam AM, Hassan MM, Elzainy TA.

2-Keto-3-deoxygluconate aldolase of Aspergillus niger, an enzyme that has not
been reported previously, was purified 468-fold. Maximal activity was obtained at
pH 8.0 and 50 C. The enzyme exhibited relative stereochemical specificity with
respect to glyceraldehyde. The Km values for 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate,
glyceraldehyde, and pyruvate were 10, 13.3, and 3.0 mM, respectively. The effects
of some compounds and inhibitors on enzyme activity were examined. Stability of
the enzyme under different conditions was investigated. The equilibrium constant 
was about 0.33 X 10(-3) M.

Chemotaxis of a motile Streptococcus toward sugars and amino acids.

van der Drift C, Duiverman J, Bexkens H, Krijnen A.

A motile Streptococcus was isolated and its chemotactic behavior toward sugars
and amino acids was studied. Motility was optimal in the presence of an exogenous
energy source and a nonionic detergent, e.g., Tween 80 or Brij-36. Both glucose
and pyruvate could serve as energy source. Chemotaxis toward leucine was optimal 
at pH 7 to 8.5 and a temperature between 30 and 37 C. The Streptococcus showed a 
chemotactic response toward a variety of sugars. All commonly occurring L-amino
acids, except alanine, asparagine, aspartate, glutamate, arginine, and lysine,
were attractants. From concentration response curves the thresholds, peak
concentrations, and optimal responses were determined.

Phospholipase D activity of gram-negative bacteria.

Cole R, Proulx P.

A phospholipase hydrolyzing cardiolipin to phosphatidic acid and phosphatidyl
glycerol was characterized in gram-negative bacteria but was absent in
preparations of gram-positive bacteria, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and rat liver
mitochondria. In cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, 
Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonase aeruginosa, this cardiolipin-hydrolyzing
enzyme had similar pH and Mg2+ requirements and displayed a specificity which
excluded phosphatidyl glycerol and phosphatidyl ethanolamine as substrates.

Expression of the hut operons of Salmonella typhimurium in Klebsiella aerogenes
and in Escherichia coli.

Parada JL, Magasanik B.

The normal hut (histidine utilization) operons, as well as those with mutations
affecting the regulation of their expression, of Salmonella typhimurium were
introduced on an F' episome into cells of S. typhimurium and Klebsiella aerogenes
whose chromosomal hut genes had been deleted and into cells of Escherichia coli, 
whose chromosome does not carry hut genes. The episomal hut operons respond in a 
manner very similar to induction and catabolite repression in all three
organisms. The small differences found reflect both different abilities to take
up inducers from the medium and different degrees of catabolite repression
exerted by glucose.

In merodiploid strains of Klebsiella aerogenes with chromosomal hut genes of K.
aerogenes and episomal hut genes of Salmonella typhimurium, the repressor of

Transport of molybdate by Clostridium pasteurianum.

Elliott BB, Mortenson LE.

The transport of 99MoO42- into dinitrogen-fixing cells of Clostridium
pasteurianum was investigated. Transport of molybdate in this organism is energy 
dependent; sucrose is required in the minimal media, and the system is inhibited 
by the glycolysis inhibitors, NaF, iodoacetic acid, and arsenate. The cells
accumulate molybdate against a concentration gradient, and the uptake shows a
marked dependence on temperature (optimum 37 C) and pH (optimum 6.0). The rate of
molybdate uptake with increasing molybdate concentrations shows saturation
kinetics with an apparent Km and Vmax of 4.8 X 10(-5) M and 55 nmol/g of dry
cells per min, respectively. Inhibition studies with the anions SO42-, S2O32-,
WO42-, and VO32- show that SO42- and WO42- competitively inhibit MoO42- uptake
(apparent Ki [SO42-] is 3.0 X 10(-5) M; apparent Ki [WO42-] is 2.4 X 10(-5),
whereas S2O32- and VO32- have no inhibitory effect. Exchange experiments with
MoO42- show that only a small percentage of the 99MoO42- taken up by the cells is
exchangeable. Exchange experiments with WO42- and SO42- indicate that once inside
the cells WO42- and SO42- cannot substitute for MoO42-.

3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthase mutants of Salmonella
typhimurium.

DeLeo AB, Sprinson DB.

The first committed step of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in Salmonella
typhimurium was shown to be catalyzed by three isoenzymes of
3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase. Mutations in
each of the genes specifying the isoenzymes were isolated and mapped. aroG, the
structural gene for the phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme, was linked to gal,
and aroH, the structural gene for the tryptophan-inhibitable isoenzyme, was
linked to aroE. aroF, the structural gene for the tyrosine-inhibitable isoenzyme,
was linked to pheA and tyrA, which specify the phenylalanine- and
tyrosine-specific branch-point enzymes, respectively. The
phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme was the predominant DAHP synthase in
wild-type cells, and only the tryosine-inhibitable isoenzyme was completely
repressed, as well as inhibited, by low levels of its allosteric effector. The
DAHP synthase isoenzymes were separated by chromatography on
diethylaminoethyl-cellulose with a phosphate gradient which contained
enolpyruvate phosphate to protect the otherwise unstable
phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme. No cross-inhibition of either the tyrosine- 
or phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme was observed at inhibitor concentrations
up to 1 mM. The tryptophan-inhibitable isoenzyme was partially purified from
extracts of a strain lacking the other two isoenzymes and shown to be inhibited
about 30% by 1 mM tryptophan. A preliminary study of interference by tryptophan
in the periodate-thiobarbiturate assay for DAHP suggested a combined effect of
tryptophan and erythrose 4-phosphate, or an aldehydic compound resulting from
degradation of erythrose 4-phosphate by periodate.

Membrane location of a deoxyribonuclease implicated in the genetic transformation
of Diplococcus pneumoniae.

Lacks S, Neuberger M.

The cellular localization of enzymes in Diplococcus pneumoniae was examined by
fractionation of spheroplasts. A deoxyribonuclease implicated in the entry of
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into the cell during genetic transformation was
located in the cell membrane. This enzyme, the major endonuclease of the cell
(endonuclease I), which is necessary for the conversion of donor DNA to single
strands inside the cell and oligonucleotides outside, thus could act at the cell 
surface. Another enzyme, the cell wall lysin (autolysin), was also found in the
membrane fraction. Other enzymes, including amylomaltase, two exonucleases, and
adenosine triphosphate-dependent deoxyribonuclease, and a restriction type
endonuclease, were located in the cytosol within the cell. None of the enzymes
examined were predominantly periplasmic in location. Spheroplasts were obtained
spontaneously on incubation of pneumococcal cells in concentrated sugar
solutions. The autolytic enzyme appears to be involved in this process. Cells
that were physiologically competent to take up DNA formed osmotically sensitive
spheroplasts two to three times faster than cells that were not in the competent 
state. Although some genetically incompetent mutants also formed spheroplasts
more slowly, other such mutants formed them at the faster rate.

Regulation of dihydrodipicolinate synthase during growth and sporulation of
Bacillus cereus.

Hoganson DA, Stahly DP.

A four- to sixfold increase in specific activity of dihydrodipicolinic acid
synthase was observed during sporulation of Bacillus cereus. The enzyme from
cells harvested before and after the increase in specific activity appeared to be
very similar as judged by pH optima, heat denaturation kinetics, apparent
Michaelis constants, chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose and Sephadex
G-200, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Studies with various combinations 
of amino acids and one of the enzyme substrates, pyruvate, failed to give
evidence for control of the enzyme by activation, inhibition, repression,
induction, or stabilization. Omission of calcium from the sporulation medium had 
no significant effect on the specific activity pattern of the enzyme as a

D-Lactate dehydrogenase of Peptostreptococcus elsdenii.

Brockman HL, Wood WA.

D-Lactate dehydrogenase has been purified to near homogeneity from
Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. As isolated, the enzyme contains flavine adenine
dinucleotide and a tightly bound metal cofactor. Inactivation by
ortho-phenanthroline occurs in two steps and is partially blocked by D-lactate.
Reactivation by divalent metal ions occurs, with divalent zinc being the most
effective. When ferricyanide is used as the electron acceptor, D-lactate has an
apparent K0.5 of 3.3 M0.46; its binding is negatively cooperative with a Hill
coefficient of 0.46. Replacement of ferricyanide by the other components of the
electron transport system yields hyperbolic kinetics with an apparent Km for
D-lactate of 26 mM. The apparent Km for ferricyanide is 2.2 X 10(-4) M. Phosphate
and pyrophosphate compounds stimulate the D-lactate:ferricyanide activity. These 
properties suggest that interaction of this enzyme with other electron transport 
proteins in the chain may enhance D-lactate binding and, hence, the rate of
electron transport.

Purification, new assay, and properties of coenzyme A transferase from
Peptostreptococcus elsdenii.

Tung KK, Wood WA.

Coenzyme A (CoA) transferase from Peptostreptococcus elsdenii has been purified
and crystallized, and some of its properties have been established. The work was 
facilitated by a newly developed coupled and continuous spectrophotometric assay 
in which the disappearance of added acrylate could be followed at 245 nm. The
rate-limiting conversion of acetyl- and beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA to acrylyl CoA 
by CoA transferase was followed by the non-rate-limiting conversion to
beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA by excess crotonase. Thus, a small priming quantity of 
acetyl CoA served to generate acrylyl CoA, which, by hydration, generated
beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA. This product then served to generate more acrylyl CoA 
in cyclic fashion. The net result was the CoA transferase-limited conversion of
acrylate to beta-hydroxypropionate. The purified transferase has a molecular
weight of 125,000 and is composed of two subunits of 63,000 each, as determined
by disc gel electrophoresis. Short-chain-length monocarboxylic acids are
substrates, whereas dicarboxylic or beta-ketocarboxylic acids are not. The
reaction kinetics are typical of a ping-pong bi bi mechanism composed of two half
reactions linked by a covalent enzyme intermediate. Incubation of the transferase
with acetyl CoA in the absence of a fatty acid acceptor yielded a stable
intermediate which, by absorption spectrophotometry, radioactivity measurements, 
reduction with borohydride, reactivity with hydroxylamine, and catalytic
activity, was identified as an enzyme-CoA compound. Kinetic constants for CoA
transferase are: final specific activity, 110 U/mg of protein corresponding to
1.38 X 10(4) mumol of acrylate activated per mumol of transferase; Km for
acrylate, 1.2 X 10(-3) M; Km for acetyl CoA (beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA), 2.4 X
10(-5) M.

Isolation and purification of Flavobacterium alpha-1,3-glucanase-hydrolyzing,
insoluble, sticky glucan of Streptococcus mutans.

Ebisu S, Kato K, Kotani S, Misaki A.

Studies were made on the physical and chemical properties of polysaccharides
synthesized by cell-free extracts of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis,
and Streptococcus sp. and their susceptibilities to dextranases. Among the
polysaccharides examined, insoluble glucans were rather resistant to available
dextranase preparations, and the insoluble, sticky glucan produced by S. mutans
OMZ 176, which could be important in formation of dental plaques, was the most
resistant. By enrichment culture of soil specimens, using OMZ 176 glucans as the 
sole carbon source, an organism was isolated that produced colonies surrounded by
a clear lytic zone on opaque agar plates containing the OMZ 176 glucan. The
organism was identified as a strain of Flavobacterium and named the Ek-14
bacterium. EK-14 bacterium was grown in Trypticase soy broth, and an enzyme
capable of hydrolyzing the OMZ 176 glucan was concentrated from the culture
supernatant and purified by negative adsorption on a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose 
(DE-32) column and gradient elution chromatography with a carboxymethyl-cellulose
(CM-32) column. The enzyme was a basic protein with an isoelectric point of pH
8.5 and molecular weight of 65,000. Its optimum pH was 6.3 and its optimal
temperature was 42 C. The purified enzyme released 11% of the total glucose
residues of the OMZ 176 glucan as reducing sugars and solubilized about half of
the substrate glucan. The products were found to be isomaltose, nigerose, and
nigerotriose, with some oligosaccharides. The purified enzyme split the
alpha-1,3-glucan endolytically and was inactive toward glucans containing
alpha-1,6, alpha-1,4, beta-1,3, beta-1,4, and/or beta-1,6 bonds as the main
linkages.

Production, purification, and characterization of an extracellular chitosanase
from Streptomyces.

Price JS, Storck R.

The synthesis by Streptomyces sp. no. 6 of an extracellular chitosanase was
induced by glucosamine. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by Sephadex G-100,
carboxymethyl-cellulose, and diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. The
purified enzyme hydrolyzed chitosan (the beta-1,4-linked polymer of glucosamine) 
but not chitin nor carboxymethyl-cellulose. The only products of the hydrolysis
detectable by paper chromatography were di- and triglucosamine. Sephadex G-100
chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
indicated that the molecular weight of the enzyme was between 29,000 and 26,000. 
Acid hydrolysates of the enzyme contained no cysteic acid or glucosamine or other
carbohydrate. At 25 C, maximum activity was obtained between pH 4.5 and 6.5. The 
enzymatic hydrolysis of chitosan occurred over a wide range of temperatures and
was maximal at 60 C. The rate of the reaction was inhibited by concentrations of 
soluble chitosan higher than 0.5 g/liter. The apparent Km calculated from a
Lineweaver-Burke plot was 0.688 g/liter at pH 5.5. The enzyme prevented spore
germination and caused a significant decrease in the turbidity of germinated
spore suspensions of the Mucor strains tested. Such a decrease was the result of 
a partial lysis of the cell wall.

Simple and sensitive procedure for screening yeast mutants that lyse at
nonpermissive temperatures.

Cabib E, Duran A.

After mutagenesis, surviving yeast cells are grown on plates at 25 C and later
exposed to 37 C. The plates are then overlaid with a soft agar containing
p-nitrophenylphosphate at pH 9.7. Lysed cells liberate alkaline phosphatase which
gives rise to a yellow color on and around colonies.

A nucleoside triphosphate-dependent deoxyribonuclease from Bacillus laterosporus.
Purification and characterization of the enzyme.

Anai M, Mihara T, Yamanaka M, Shibata T, Takagi Y.

A deoxyribonuclease, which requires nucleoside triphosphate for reaction, has
been purified about 150-fold from extracts of Bacillus laterosporus. Potassium
phosphate and ethylene glycol stabilize the purified enzyme. The enzyme degrades 
double-stranded DNA about 100 times faster than heat-denatured DNA in the
presence of nucleoside triphosphate. Double-stranded DNA is not degraded to any
measurable extent in the absence of ATP, but the enzyme exhibits activity toward 
denatured DNA in the absence of nucleoside triphosphate, and this activity seems 
to be an intrinsic property of this enzyme protein. The optimum pH is 8.5 and the
maximum activity is obtained in the copresence of Mg2+ (8.0 X 10(-3)M) and Mn2+
(7.0 X 10(-5)M). ATP and dATP are most effective and nucleoside di- or
monophosphates are ineffective. ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate
during the reaction and the ratio of the amount of ATP cleaved to that of
hydrolyzed phosphodiester bonds of DNA is about 3:1. An inhibitor of the enzyme
was observed in bacterial extracts prepared by sonic disruption; the inhibitory
substance is produced in the bacteria in the later stages of cell growth.
Preliminary results show that the inhibitor emerged near the void volume of a
Sephadex G-200 column, and was relatively heat-stable, RNase-resistant, and
DNase-sensitive.

Rapid radioimmunoassay for guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate using tritiated
ligand.

Fujimoto M, Mihara S, Okabayashi T, Sugase T, Tarui S.

A radioimmunoassay procedure for guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (CGMP) is
described. The procedure is based on competitive binding between [3H]CGMP and
non-radioactive CGMP, with separation of bound and unbound CGMP by Millipore
filtration. The binding reaction showed very high specificity to CGMP, had a
broad pH optimum, and reached equilibrium within a short time. A simple procedure
for the pruification of assay samples using Dowex AG 50W-X2 resin is also
described. CGMP contents in urine samples were assayed without purification.
Injection of glucagon into healthy human volunteers resulted in a small but
significant reduction in urinary CGMP level, whereas CAMP excretion increased
dramatically.

The effect of tryptophan administration on fatty acid synthesis in the livers of 
rats under various nutritional conditions.

Miyazawa S, Sakurai T, Shindo Y, Imura M, Hashimoto T.

1. Tryptophan was administered to rats under various nutritional conditions:
fasted for 24 hr, fasted and refed with glucose or corn-oil, fasted and
administered glycerol intramuscularly, and nonfasted. 2. The changes in the
contents of glycolytic intermediates in the livers indicated that the
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [EC 4.1.1.32] reaction is inhibited by
tryptophan administration in all groups of rats. The inversely related changes in
the contents of malate and phosphoenolpyruvate were associated with the
accumulation of quinolinate in the livers. The content of quinolinate which
exhibited the half-maximal effect on the contents of both metabolites was 0.1-0.2
mumole per g liver. 3. The rate of incorporation of 3H from 3H2O into the total
hepatic fatty acids was increased about 2-fold by the administration of this
amino acid to the fasted rats. The enhancement of the rate was closely related to
the increase in the citrate content. The hyperlipogenesis was also related to the
decrease of acetyl-CoA and the increase of malonyl-CoA. The content of long-chain
acyl-CoA was not affected. These effects of tryptophan administration on the
hepatic fatty acid metabolism were found in all groups of rats. The liver content
of glycerol 3-phosphate was decreased by tryptophan administration was markedly
increased by glycerol injection. The injection of glycerol into the control and
the tryptophan-treated rats produced a marked increase of glycerol 3-phosphate
but did not affect the rate of fatty acid synthesis in the livers of either
group. 4. It may be concluded that, in the livers of rats under various
nutritional conditions, the short-term control of fatty acid synthesis by
tryptophan administration is most likely due to the activation of acetyl-coenzyme
A carboxylase [EC 6.4.1.2] by citrate.

Electrophoretic investigations of the acid conformational change of
alpha-lactalbumin.

Kuwajima K, Nitta K, Sugai S.

In order to clarify how the electrophoretic behavior reflects the conformational 
transition of globular proteins, moving boundary electrophoresis was applied to
analysis of the acid conformational change of alpha-lactalbumin. The appearance
of only a single electrophoretic boundary in the transition region of the protein
suggests a very rapid transition with a half-time estimated to be smaller than 7 
min on the basis of the theory of isomerizing systems in electrophoresis. The
transition is clearly reflected in the dependence of the mobility on the protein 
net charge, which shows a sigmoidal curve closely similar to that obtained by a
Linderstrøm-Lang pH-tritration plot for the carboxyl groups of alpha-lactalbumin.
It was also concluded from the transition curves that the acidfication does not
result in complete unfolding, but that a compact structure is maintained in the
acidic region with an apparently expanded form as compared to the native state of
the protein. All results obtained by electrophoresis were also supported by the
results of pH-jump studies, analytical gel chromatography, and CD measurements.

Studies on cathepsins of rat liver lysosomes. II. Comparative studies on multiple
forms of cathepsin A.

Matsuda K, Misaka E.

The multiple forms of cathepsin A (AI, AII, and AIII) purified from the lysosome 
fraction of rat liver by Sephadex G-200 and DEAE-Sephadex chromatographies were
studied comparatively. Forms AI, AII and AIII were stable between pH 3.0 and 5.5,
and had pH optima for CBZ-Glu-Phe at 5.6, 5.8, and 5.9, respectively. These
activities were rapidly lost on heating above 60 degrees. Their isoelectric
points were at 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9, and the Michaelis constants for CBZ-Glu-Phe
were calculated as 10, 6.6, and 4.2 X 10(-4)M, respectively. Activity was
inhibited by Ag+, Au3+, Hg2+, iodine, and p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB).
Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF),
toluenesuffonyl fluoride (TSF), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were inhibitory 
at a concentration of 10(-3)M. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, pepstatin, leupeptins, 
and antipain were not inhibitory, while chymostatin caused slight inhibition. No 
distinct difference was observed in the effects of these compounds on the
multiple forms of cathepsin A despite differences in the molecular weights of
these forms (100,000, 200,000, and 420,000, respectively). In immuno-diffusion
analysis, cathepsin AI, AII, and AIII which had been treated with EDTA,
dithiothreitol, PCMB, and a high concentration of NaCl, gave the same precipitin 
patterns as the untreated enzymes, but treatment with 6 M urea caused a slight
alteration of the pattern. After SDS-treatment (50 mM or more), the precipitin
lines of these multiple forms fused and gave a single, identical line. This
suggests that the different forms of the cathepsin A are all composed of subunits
which are immunologically identical or closely related, and that the subunits are
mainly bound by hydrophobic forces. This conclusion is supported by results
obtained by poliacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS.

Recombination of ciliary dynein of Tetrahymena with the outer fibers.

Shimizu T.

Recombination of ciliary dyneins of Tetrahymena pyriformis with the outer fibers 
was investigated using turbidimetry, co-sedimentation analysis and electron
microscopy. As reported by Gibbons, 30S dynein could recombine with the outer
fibers, while 14S dynein did to so a lesser extent. At acidic pH, however, most
of the 14S dynein was also rebound to the outer fibers. When an excess of crude
dynein fraction was added to the outer fiber fraction at pH 8.2, electron
microscopic observations showed that the outer doublet microtubules were
decorated not only with arms but also with other electron-dense materials. On the
other hand, when crude dynein fraction was mixed with the outer fibers in an
appropriate quantity, only arms were reconstituted at the regular positions of
A-subfibers. ATP had an inhibitory effect on the recombination of dynein with the
outer fibers.

Affinity labeling of D-amino acid oxidase with an acetylenic substrate.

Horiike K, Nishina Y, Miyake Y, Yamano T.

The acetylenic substrate, D-2-amino-4-pentynoic acid (D-propargylglycine), was
oxidatively deaminated by hog kidney D-amino acid oxidase[EC 1.4.3.3], with
accompanying inactivation of the enzyme. The flavin which was extracted by hot
methanol from the inactivated enzyme was identical with authentic FAD by
thin-layer chromatography and circular dichroism. The excitation spectrum of
emission at 520 nm of the released flavin was very similar to the absorption
spectrum of oxidized FAD. The released flavin was reduced by potassium
borohydride. The apoenzyme prepared after propargylglycine treatment did not show
restored D-amino acid oxidase activity on adding exogenous FAD. The absorption
spectrum of this inactivated apoenzyme showed absorption peaks at 279 and 317 nm,
and a shoulder at about 290 nm. These results strongly indicate that the
inactivation reaction is a dynamic affinity labeling with D-propargylglycine
which produces irreversible inactivation of the enzyme by a covalent modification
of an amino acid residue at the active site.

Studies on trypsin inhibitor in barley. I. Purification and some properties.

Ogiso T, Noda T, Sako Y, Kato Y, Aoyama M.

To clarify the properties and functions of a trypsin inhibitor from Japanese
barley in comparison with the inhibitor from Pirkka barley, an inhibitor was
isolated from the barley Hordeum distichum L var. emend Lamark by extraction with
1% NaCl, ammonium sulfate fractionation and repeated chromatography on
DEAE-cellulose and CM-cellulose. The final purified preparation of the inhibitor 
was found to be homogeneous by both chromatographic and electrophoretic analysis.
The inhibitor was thermostable and was stable over the broad pH range from 2 to
11. No inhibition was observed by heavy metal ions and many reagents at 10(-2) M,
except that p-chloromercuribenzoate caused a 69% loss of activity. The inhibitor 
was subjected to isoelectric focusing at pH 7.51 and its molecular weight was
calculated to be 14,200+/-900 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the
presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The apparent dissociation constant for the
complex between the inhibitor and trypsin[EC 3.4.21.4] was 1.64 X 10(-7)M with
casein as a substrate. One microgram of purified inhibitor inhibited 1.5 mug of
pure trypsin in the hydrolysis of alpha-N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide. By 
chemical modification of arginyl residues in the inhibitor with
1,2-cyclohexanedione, the inhibitor was shown to be an arginine inhibitor. The
inhibitor contained relatively many basic amino acids and few half cystines as
compared with Pirkka barley trypsin inhibitor.

Metabolism of dog gastric mucosa. Nucleotide levels in parietal cells.

Sarau HM, Foley J, Moonsammy G, Wiebelhaus VD.

Adenine and pyridine nucleotide levels as well as those of phosphate,
phosphocreatine, lactate, pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, glucose, 
and glycogen were measured in histologically defined parietal and mucous cell
sections of biopsies of dog gastric mucosa at rest, and in various secretory
states. As a result of stimulation of secretion, there appeared to be no change
in adenine nucleotide levels, or phosphocreatine, but there was a rise in
inorganic phosphate and a fall in phosphorylation potential. However, there was a
marked increase in NADH, but no change in NADPH with onset of acid secretion. The
increase in the lactate to pyruvate ratio showed that the increased NADH level
occurred in the cytoplasm and these data are discussed with reference to change
in cell pH.

Metal ion dependence of the binding of triiodothyronine by cytosol proteins of
bullfrog tadpole tissues.

Yoshizato K, Kistler A, Frieden E.

The binding of triiodothyronine by Rana catesbeiana tadpole tail fin, tail
muscle, kidney, and liver cytosol was studied using dextran-coated charcoal to
separate bound and free hormone. A metal ion dependency was suggested by the fact
that EDTA decreased the binding of triiodothyronine 80 to 90% in tail fin and
tail muscle cytosol. Inhibition of binding in kidney or liver was less, 40 to
50%. This inhibition could be restored by adding an excess of divalent cations
with an order of potency of Mn2+ greater than Ca2+ congruent to Co2+ greater than
Sr2+ greater than Ba2+ greater than Mg2+. Other chelators, e.g. o-phenanthroline,
8-hydroxyquinoline, and ethylene glycol
bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetate also decreased the binding of
triiodothyronine, whereas citrate, oxalate, imidazole, and glycine had no effect.
The triiodothyronine binding capacity of tail fin cytosol was reduced by EDTA
treatment and dialysis against buffer. Ca2+ in the 1 to 10 mM range and Mn2+ at 1
mM could restore the binding to normal levels. Higher Mn2+ increased binding 70% 
above normal or to Ca2+-restored levels. The triiodothyronine cytosol binding
activity was nondialyzable, heat-labile. pH-dependent, pronase-digestible, but
unaffected by incubation with trypsin, RNase, and DNase, suggesting that the
cytosol binding sites are acidic proteins. Scatchard analysis of triiodothyronine
binding by the cytosol of different tissues, revealed Kassoc of 7.1 x 10(6)
M(-1), 11.6 x 10(6) M(-1), 3.6 X 10(6) M(-1), and 68.0 x 10(6) M(-1) for tail
fin, tail muscle, kidney, and liver cytosol, respectively. The corresponding
maximal binding capacities in picomoles per mg of crude cytosol protein in these 
four tissues were 10.4, 0.86, 1.3, and 0.04, respectively.

The active form of cytochrome P-450 from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria.

Takagi Y, Shikita M.

Cytochrome P-450 from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria exists in three forms of
molecular weight: 850,000 (protein 16), of one-half (protein 8), and of
one-quarter of this value (protein 4). The forms of the enzyme are named
according to the number of subunits and all appear to be active in converting
cholesterol to 3beta-hydroxy-5-pregnen-20-one (side chain cleavage) (Shikita, M.,
and Hall, P.F. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5606). To determine whether all three
forms are active at their characteristic molecular weights, the three cytochromes
were each layered onto separate sucrose density gradients and centrifuged at
49,000 rpm for 60 min; the gradients contained all the factors necessary for side
chain cleavage including one of the following substrates: cholesterol,
20S-hydroxycholesterol, and 20S,22R-dihydroxycholesterol. Regardless of the form 
of P-450 layered onto the gradient and regardless of the substrate, enzyme
activity (side chain cleavage) was observed only in fractions corresponding to a 
sedimentation coefficient of 20 to 22 S which is that for protein 16. No activity
was observed at S values corresponding to either protein 8 or protein 4. These
findings indicate that the active form of cytochrome P-450 from adrenocortical
mitochondria is that containing 16 subunits, i.e. the form in which the
cytochrome is normally isolated from adrenal mitochondria. Forms consisting of
eight and four subunits which can be prepared from protein 16 become active only 
by forming protein 16, at least in an aqueous medium in vitro.

Effects of strong electrolyte upon the activity of Clostridium perfringens
sialidase toward sialyllactose and sialoglycolipids.

Barton NW, Lipovac V, Rosenberg A.

Clostridium perfringens sialidase was purified by affinity chromatography.
Kinetic properties of the enzyme were examined with sialyllactose and with mixed 
sialoglycolipids (gangliosides) as substrates. With the latter substrate in 0.01 
M Tris-acete in the absence of strong electrolyte, the pH optimum for enzymatic
activity was 6.8. Addition of strong electrolyte (0.01 to 0.10 M Nac1) to the
reaction medium caused an acidic shift and a broadening of the pH optimum,
Enzymatic activity at pH 5.8 rose approximately 2.5-fold; a concomitant loss of
activity at pH 6.8 was also observed. The alteration of enzymatic activity caused
by strong electrolyte were dependent upon changes in Vmax. Km remained nearly
invariant. Thus, a reversible transition of the enzyme from a relatively inactive
to a highly active form occurred as a function of strong electrolyte
concentration. Determination of the pK values of the active functional groups of 
C. perfringens sialidase revealed that the effects of strong electrolyte were
exerted upon the pKa group of the enzyme. Strong electrolyte appeared to shield
unfavorable electrostatic interactions between polyanionic sialoglycolipid
micelles and the enzyme molecule, thus protecting the pKa group from
inactivation. In comparision with the effects of strong electrolyte upon
enzymatic activity toward the sialoglycolipid substrate, those observed with the 
monovalent substrate, sialyllacthose, were minor. Collectively, these findings
indicate that ionic environment may effectively control the activity and relative
substrate specificity of C. perfringens sialidase at a given pH. Furthermore,
they explain the low pH optima and skewed pH profiles previously reported for
enzymatic activity toward high molecular weight substrates.

Reconstitution of ion transport and respiratory control in vesicles formed from
reduced coenzyme Q-cytochrome c reductase and phospholipids.

Leung KH, Hinkle PC.

Reduced coenzyme Q-cytochrome c reductase from bovine heart mitochondria (complex
III) was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by the cholate dialysis
procedure. Soybean phospholipids or mixtures of purified phosphatidylcholine,
phosphatidylethanolamine, and cardiolipin could be used. Oxidation of reduced
coenzyme Q2 by the reconstituted vesicles with cytochrome c as oxidant showed the
following energy-coupling phenomena. 1. Protons were translocated outward with a 
coupling ratio, H+/2e, of 1.9 +/- 0.2. Measurements with mitochondria under
similar conditions showed an H+/2e ratio of 1.8. Proton translocation was not
seen in the presence of uncoupling agents and was in addition to the net
acidification of the medium from the over-all oxidation reaction. 2. Potassium
ions were taken up by the reconstituted vesicles in the presence of valinomycin
in a reaction coupled to electron transfer. The coupling ratio for K+ uptake,
K+/2e, was 2.0 in the vesicles and approximately 1.5 in mitochondria. 3. The rate
of oxidation of reduced coenzyme Q2 by the reconstituted vesicles was stimulated 
up to 10-fold by uncouplers or by valinomycin plus nigericin and K+ ions.
Addition of valinomycin alone in a K+ medium caused a transient stimulation of
electron transfer. The results indicate that energy coupling can be observed with
isolated reduced coenzyme Q-cytochrome c reductase if the enzyme complex is
properly incorporated into a phospholipid vesicle.

Ion transport and respiratory control in vesicles formed from reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide coenzyme Q reductase and phospholipids.

Ragan CI, Hinkle PC.

NADH-coenzyme Q reductase from bovine heart mitochondria (complex I) was
incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by the cholate dialysis procedure.
Mixtures of purified phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were
required. Oxidation of NADH by coenzyme Q1 catalyzed by the reconstituted
vesicles was coupled to proton translocation, directed inward, with an H+/2e
ratio greater than 1.4. Similar experiments measuring proton translocation in
submitochondrial particles gave an H+/2e ratio of 1.8. The proton translocation
in both systems was not seen in the presence of uncoupling agents and was in
addition to the net proton uptake from the reduction of coenzyme Q1 by NADH.
Electron transfer in the reconstituted vesicles also caused the uptake of the
permeant anion tetraphenylboron. The rate of electron transfer by the
reconstituted vesicles was stimulated about 3-fold by uncouplers or by
valinomycin plus nigericin and K+ ions. The results indicate that energy coupling
can be observed with isolated NADH-coenzyme Q reductase if the enzyme complex is 
properly incorporated into a phospholipid vesicle.

sn-Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity in particulate preparations from
anaerobic, light-grown cells of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides. Involvement of acyl 
thiolester derivatives of acyl carrier protein in the synthesis of complex
lipids.

Lueking DR, Goldfine H.

Crude particulate preparations obtained from anaerobic, light-grown cells of
Rhodopseudomonas spheroides have been shown to possess a significant level of
sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.15) activity. In contrast to
the enzyme from Escherichia coli, the R. spheroides glycerophosphate
acyltransferase has a high specificity for acyl thiolester derivatives of acyl
carrier protein (ACP) as acyl donors for the reaction. Only limited , nonlinear
glycerophosphate incorporation into lipid occurs when acyl coenzyme A (CoA)
derivatives are employed as acyl substrate. With oleyl-ACP as substrate, maximal 
enzyme activity was observed at 40 degrees, over a broad pH range (6.0 to 8.5)
and did not require a divalent metal cation. The presence of dithiothreitol
stimulated enzyme-activity 15 to 20%. When oleyl-ACP or palmityl-ACP was employed
as sole acyl group donor, the major products recoverable from the reaction
mixtures were lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidic acid, and monoglyceride.
Althouh oleyl-ACP and palmityl-ACP gave comparable maximal velocities in the
initial acylation of glycerophosphate, the formation of phosphatidic acid
occurred preferentially with the unsaturated acyl-ACP derivative.

Studies on thyroid hormone-binding proteins. I. The subunit structure of human
thyroxine-binding globulin and its interaction with ligands.

Nilsson SF, Peterson PA.

Thyroxine-binding globulin was isolated from human plasma by ammonium sulfate
fractionation, chromatographic separations on diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex, gel
chromatography, and two different electrophoretic procedures. The highly purified
was homogeneous when subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
ultracentrifugation analyses, and immunochemical determinations. The weight
average molecular weight as determined by sedimentation equilibrium
ultracentrifugations was 54,000 and by sedimentation diffusion data 55,000. Amino
acid analyses indicated a minimum of 110 amino acid residues per molecule. By
determination of the minimum in the curve for the fraction of maximum deviation
from the amino acid analyses it was found that the minimum molecular weight for
the polypeptide was 12,200. Carbohydrate analyses demonstrated the presence f
equimolar amounts of amnnose, galactose, and glucosamine, and the carbohydrate
portion constituted 7.5% of the total weight. The amino acid analyses suggested
that thyroxine-binding globulin is composed of 4 subunits. Molecular weight
determinations by gel chromatography in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride indicated the
presence of three species of globulin with apparent molecular weights 52,000,
25,000, and 13,500, respectively. Prolonged storage in guanidine hydrochloride
promoted a more than 60% yield of the monomeric species. Moreover, a
half-molecule of thyroxine-binding globulin was isolated and shown to consist of 
two polypeptide chains of similar molecular weight...

Structural studies of two ovalbumin glycopeptides in relation to the
endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase specificity.

Tai T, Yamashita K, Ogata-Arakawa M, Koide N, Muramatsu T, Iwashita S, Inoue Y,
Kobata A.

Heterogeneities of the two ovalbumin glycopeptides, (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn and
(Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn, were revealed by borate paper electrophoresis of
oligosaccharide alcohols obtained from the glycopeptides by
endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion and NaB3H4 reduction. The
structures of the major components of the oligosaccharides were determined by the
combination of methylation analysis, acetolysis, and alpha-mannosidase digestion.
Based on the results, the whole structures of the major components of
(Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn and (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn were elucidated as Manalpha1 leads to
6[Manalpha1 leads to 3]-Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 3[Manbeta1 leads 
to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAc leads to Asn and Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 
leads to 3]Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 2Manalpha1 leads to 3]Manbeta1
leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to GlcNAc leads to Asn, respectively. Since
endo-beta-N-acetylglucosamini dase D hydrolyzes (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn but not
(Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn, the presence of the unsubstituted alpha-mannosyl residue
linked at the C-3 position of the terminal mannose of Manbeta1 leads to
4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4 GlcNAcAsn core must be essential for the action of the
enzyme.

Use of 5-deazaFAD to study hydrogen transfer in the D-amino acid oxidase
reaction.

Hersh LB, Jorns MS.

The apoprotein of hog kidney D-amino acid oxidase was reconstituted with
5-deazaflavin adenine dinucleotide (5-deazaFAD) to yield a protein which contains
1.5 mol of 5-deazaFAD/mol of enzyme. The deazaFAD-containing enzyme forms
complexes with benzoate, 2-amino benzoate, and 4-aminobenzoate which are both
qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed with native enzyme.
The complex with 2-aminobenzoate exhibits a new long wavelength absorption band
characteristic of a flavin charge-transfer complex. The reconstituted enzyme
exhibits no activity when assayed by D-alanine oxidation. However, the bound
chromophore can be reduced by alanine, phenylalanine, proline, methionine, and
valine, but not by glutamate or aspartate, indicating the deazaFAD enzyme retains
the substrate specificity of the native enzyme. Reduction of the enzyme by
D-alanine exhibits a 1.6-fold deuterium isotope effect. Reoxidation of the
reduced enzyme occurred in the presence of pyruvate plus ammonia, but not with
pyruvate alone or ammonia alone. beta-Phenylpyruvate and alpha-ketobutyrate, but 
not alpha-ketoglutarate could replace pyruvate. Reduced enzyme isolated following
reaction with [alpha-3H]alanine was found to contain 0.5 mol of tritium/mol of
deazaFADH2. After denaturation of the tritium-labeled enzyme, the radioactivity
was identified as deazaFADH2. Reaction of the reduced tritium-labeled enzyme with
pyruvate plus ammonia prior to denaturation yields [alpha-3H]alanine and
unlabeled deazaFAD. These results suggest that reduction and reoxidation of
enzyme-bound deazaFAD involves the stereo-specific transfer of alpha-hydrogen
from substrate to deazaFAD.

The NSILA-s receptor in liver plasma membranes. Characterization and comparison
with the insulin receptor.

Megyesi K, Kahn CR, Roth J, Neville DM Jr, Nissley SP, Humbel RE, Froesch ER.

NSILA-s (nonsuppressible insulin-like activity, soluble in acid ethanol) is a
serum peptide that has insulin-like and growth-promoting activities. We have
demonstrated previously that liver plasma membranes possess separate receptors
for NSILA-s and insulin and have characterized the insulin receptor in detail. In
the present study we have characterized the properties and specificity of the
NSILA-s receptor and compared them to those of the insulin receptor in the same
tissue. Both 125I-NSILA-s and 125I-insulin bind rapidly and reversibly to their
receptors in liver membranes; maximal NSILA-s binding occurs at 20 degrees while 
maximal insulin binding is seen at 1-4 degrees. The pH optimum for NSILA-s
binding is broad (6.0 to 8.0), in contrast to the very sharp pH optimum (7.5 to
8.0) for insulin binding. Both receptors exhibit a high degree of specificity.
With the insulin receptor, NSILA-s and insulin analogues compete for binding in
proportion to their insulin-like potency: insulin greater than proinsulin greater
than NSILA-s. With the NSILA-s receptor, NSILA-s is most potent and the order is 
reversed: NSILA-s greater than proinsulin greater than insulin. Furthermore, six 
preparations of NSILA-s which varied 70-fold in biological activity competed for 
125I-NSILA-s binding in order of their potencies. NSILA-s which had been
inactivated biologically by reduction and aminoethylation and growth hormone were
less than 1/100,000 as potent as the most purified NSILA-s preparation. Purified 
preparations of fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, nerve growth
factor, and somatomedins B and C were less than 1% as effective as NSILA-s in
competing for the 125I-NSILA-s suggesting that these factors act through other
receptors. In contrast, somatomedin A was 10% as active as NSILA-s and
multiplication-stimulating activity was fully as active as NSILA-s in competing
for the NSILA-s receptor. Analysis of the data suggests that there are
approximately 50 times more insulin receptors than NSILA-s receptors per liver
cell, while the apparent affinity of NSILA-s receptors is somewhat higher than
that of the insulin receptor.

Decarboxylation of oxalacetate to pyruvate by purified avian liver
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.

Noce PS, Utter MF.

Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which has been isolated from chicken liver
mitochondria in essentially homogenous form, carries out the irreversible
decarboxylation of oxalacetate to pyruvate in the presence of catalytic amounts
of GDP or IDP, as well as the reversible decarboxylation of oxalacetate to
phosphoenolpyruvate in the presence of substrate amounts of GTP or ITP. The
pyruvate- and phosphoenolpyruvate-forming reactions are similar in their
nucleoside specificity and appear to be carried out by the same protein. However,
the two activities vary markedly in their response to added metal ions and
sulfhydryl reagents. Phosphoenolpyruvate formation is completely dependent on the
presence of a divalent metal ion, with Mn2+ the most effective species. This
reaction is also stimulated by sulfhydryl reagents such as 2-mercaptoethanol. In 
contrast, the pyruvate-forming reaction is strongly inhibited by divalent metal
ions, including Mn2+, and also by moderate concentrations of sulfhydryl reagents.
These observations and the demonstration that pyruvate kinase-like activity is
very low or absent make it unlikely that pyruvate formation proceeds via
phosphoenolpyruvate as an intermediate. Although the pyruvate-forming reaction is
inhibited by added metal ions, the reaction is also inhibited by metal-chelating 
agents such as 8-hydroxyquinoline and o-phenanthroline, suggesting that the
reaction is dependent on the presence of a metal ion. It has not been possible,
however, to demonstrate that the enzyme is a metalloprotein.

Hemoglobin Deer Lodge (beta 2 His replaced by Arg). Consequences of altering the 
2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding site.

Bonaventura J, Bonaventura C, Sullivan B, Godette G.

Hemoglobin Deer Lodge is an abnormal human hemoglobin with arginine substituted
for histidine at the beta 2 position. X-ray crystallography of normal human
hemoglobin has shown that the beta 2 residue is normally part of the binding site
for 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 
affects both the kinetics and equilibria of ligand binding. When stripped of
anions, Hb Deer Lodge has an increased oxygen affinity and a decreased degree of 
cooperativity relative to Hb A. The alkaline Bohr effect is slightly increased
and there are marked increases in oxygen affinity below pH 6 and above pH 8. In
the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate the cooperativity in increases to nromal
and the pH dependence of oxygen binding is reduced. This contrasts with the
enhanced Bohr effect seen for Hb A in the presence of organic phosphates. Due to 
enhanced anion binding at high pH, Hb Deer Lodge has a slightly lower oxygen
affinity than Hb A at pH 9 in the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or inositol 
hexaphosphate. Kinetic studies at neutral pH in the absence of organic phosphates
revealed biphasicity in the rate of oxygen dissociation from Hb Deer Lodge, while
approximately linear time courses were observed for Hb A. The fast phase of the
oxygen dissociation kinetics shows great pH sensitivity, and organic phosphates
increase the rate and percentage of the fast phase without greatly affecting the 
slow phase. The two phases are not resolvable at high pH. CO combination kinetics
are much like those of Hb A except that "fast" and "slow" phases were apparent at
wavelengths near the deoxy-CO isobestic point. We suggest that functional
differences between the alpha and beta chains are enhanced in Hb Deer Lodge.
After flash photolysis of the CO derivative, the percentage of quickly reacting
material was slightly greater for Hb Deer Lodge than for Hb A. This may imply a
somewhat greater tendency to dissociate into high affinity subunits. The
substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 thus results in a macromolecule 
whose ligand-binding properties are significantly altered, the primary
differences being expressed at high pH where Hb Deer Lodge binds anions more
strongly than Hb A. The properties of Hb Deer Lodge are compared to those of
other hemoglobin variants with substitutions at residues involved in binding of
2,3-diphosphoglycerate.

Patterns of fatty acid release from endogenous substrates by human platelet
homogenates and membranes.

Derksen A, Cohen P.

We describe a method for measuring the release of fatty acids from endogenous
substrates of human platelet homogenates and membranes. The method depends on the
availability of lipids whose fatty acids are odd-chained and therefore suitable
as internal reference compounds that, at the time of lipid extraction, can be
added to an incubation to permit subsequent quantification of the content of free
fatty acids or fatty acids esterified to specific lipids. We found four types of 
lipolytic activities in human platelets. In homogenates at pH 4.0 a triglyceride 
lipase operated as shown by the synchrony of triglyceride degradation and release
of glycerol and those fatty acids that are the predominant constituents of
triglycerides. However, enough arachidonic acid was released at this pH level to 
suggest some phospholipid breakdown, since triglycerides hold relatively small
amounts of this acid. With membranous preparations, in the alkaline pH range
there were two peaks of fatty acid release with accompanying degradation of
phospholipids. At pH 8.5, where release of the saturated acids, palmitic and
stearic, predominated, their sum was 3.5 times that of arachidonic acid. At pH
9.5 the release of palmitic and stearic acids was only slightly below their peak 
values; however, the release of arachidonic acid nearly equaled the sum of the
saturated acids. Linoleic acid was not released in representative amounts by
those reactions that released arachidonic acid, despite the overwhelming
propensity of both to be esterified at the 2-position of phospholipids.
Pertinently, the choline phospholipids are linoleic-rich and the non-choline
phospholipids linoleic-poor, while both have a generous endowment of arachidonic 
acid. With this in mind, we raise the possibility that the phospholipase A2 of
human platelets is an endoenzyme because of its tendency to act on those
phospholipids that are thought to comprise the inner layer of the cell membrane.

Oxidation of NADPH by submitochondrial particles from beef heart in complete
absence of transhydrogenase activity from NADPH to NAD.

Djavadi-Ohaniance L, Hatefi H.

Treatment of submitochondrial particles (ETP) with trypsin at 0 degrees destroyed
NADPH leads to NAD (or 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, AcPyAD)
transhydrogenase activity. NADH oxidase activity was unaffected; NADPH oxidase
and NADH leads to AcPyAD transhydrogenase activities were diminished by less than
10%. When ETP was incubated with trypsin at 30 degrees, NADPH leads to NAD
transhydrogenase activity was rapidly lost, NADPH oxidase activity was slowly
destroyed, but NADH oxidase activity remained intact. The reduction pattern by
NADPH, NADPH + NAD, and NADH of chromophores absorbing at 475 minus 510 nm
(flavin and iron-sulfur centers) in complex I (NADH-ubiquinone reductase) or ETP 
treated with trypsin at 0 degrees also indicated specific destruction of
transhydrogenase activity. The sensitivity of the NADPH leads to NAD
transhydrogenase reaction to trypsin suggested the involvement of susceptible
arginyl residues in the enzyme. Arginyl residues are considered to be positively 
charged binding sites for anionic substrates and ligands in many enzymes.
Treatment of ETP with the specific arginine-binding reagent, butanedione,
inhibited transhydrogenation from NADPH leads to NAD (or AcPyAD). It had no
effect on NADH oxidation, and inhibited NADPH oxidation and NADH leads to AcPyAD 
transhydrogenation by only 10 to 15% even after 30 to 60 min incubation of ETP
with butanedione. The inhibition of NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenation was
diminished considerably when butanedione was added to ETP in the presence of NAD 
or NADP. When both NAD and NADP were present, the butanedione effect was
completely abolished, thus suggesting the possible presence of arginyl residues
at the nucleotide binding site of the NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase enzyme.
Under conditions that transhydrogenation from NADPH to NAD was completely
inhibited by trypsin or butanedione, NADPH oxidation rate was larger than or
equal to 220 nmol min-1 mg-1 ETP protein at pH 6.0 and 30 degrees. The above
results establish that in the respiratory chain of beef-heart mitochondria NADH
oxidation, NADPH oxidation, and NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenation are
independent reactions.

Protein inhibitor of acid deoxyribonucleases. Improved purification procedure and
properties.

Lesca P.

A method is described for the extensive purification of acid deoxyribonuclease
(acid DNase) and its specific inhibitor from beef liver, the existence of which
had been only supported by indirect evidence. By the use of insolubilized acid
deoxyribonuclease, eight other proteins interacting with the enzyme have been
detected. One of them (molecular weight, 59,000) was identified as responsible
for phosphodiesterase activity which is often a contaminant of DNase
preparations. Acid DNase (free of phosphodiesterase) and its inhibitor have been 
obtained as homogeneous proteins, as determined by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of acid DNase
and its inhibitor are, respectively, 26,500 and 21,500; those of other proteins
range from 17,000 to 112,000. The properties of beef liver acid DNase are similar
to those described for the enzymes extracted from other sources. The same
alteration of DNase kinetics by this inhibitor, as that previously demonstrated
with an impure protein has been confirmed; the sigmoidal shape observed at pH 5
for the plot of initial rate versus substrate concentration progressively
disappears with increasing pH. We have also demonstrated that RNA, which inhibits
the acid DNase through a competitive binding to the catalytic site, is able, like
the substrate, to reverse the binding of inhibitor to the enzyme.

Nucleotide-metabolizing enzymes in Chlamydomonas flagella.

Watanabe T, Flavin M.

Nucleotides have at least two functions in eukaryotic cilia and flagella. ATP,
originating in the cells, is utilized for motility by energy-transducing
protein(s) called dynein, and the binding of guanine nucleotides to tubulin, and 
probably certain transformations of the bound nucleotides, are prerequisites for 
the assembly of microtubules. Besides dynein, which can be solubulized from
Chlamydomonas flagella as a heterogeneous, Mg2+ or Ca2+-activated ATPase, we have
purified and characterized five other flagellar enzymes involved in nucleotide
transformations. A homogeneous, low molecular weight, Ca2+-specific adenosine
triphosphatase was isolated, which was inhibited by Mg2+ and was not specific for
ATP. This enzyme was not formed by treating purified dynein with proteases. It
was absent from extracts of Tetrahymena cilia. Its function might be an auxiliary
energy transducer, or in steering or tactic responses. Two species of adenylate
kinase were isolated, one of which was much elevated in regenerating flagella;
the latter was also present in cell bodies. A large part of flagellar nucleoside 
diphosphokinase activity could not be solubilized. Two soluble enzyme species
were identified, one of which was also present in cell bodies. Since these
enzymes are of interest because they might function in microtubule assembly, we
studied the extent to which brain nucleoside diphosphokinase co-polymerizes with 
tubulin purified by repeated cycles of polymerization. Arginine kinase was not
detected in Chlamydomonas flagellar extracts.

In vitro biosynthesis of sialosylgalactosylceramide (G7) by mouse brain
microsomes.

Yu RK, Lee SH.

A sialytransferase activity which catalyzes the synthesis of
sialosylgalactosylceramide (G7) from added galactocerebroside and
CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid has been demonstrated in mouse brain microsomes. The 
enzyme reaction shows a pH optimum of 6.3 and requires detergents. Both Mn2+ and 
Ca2+ inhibited the reaction, whereas Mg2+ had no effect. The apparent Km for
galactocerebroside leading to G7 was estimated to be 8.7 X 10(-4) M. The same
microsomal preparation also synthesized hematoside when ceramide lactoside was
the glycolipid acceptor. The apparent Km for ceramide lactoside was about
one-tenth that for galactocerebroside. When the preparations were partially
inactivated by heat the synthesis of G7 and of hematoside was reduced at
approximately the same rate. Liver appeared to have the highest activity for G7
synthesis (as well as of hematoside), followed by brain. The synthesis of B7 by
mouse brain microsomes in vitro demonstrates a new pathway for brain ganglioside 
synthesis.

Proteolytic enzymes of the K-1 strain of Streptomyces griseus obtained from a
commercial preparation (Pronase). Purification and characterization of the
carboxypeptidase.

Seber JF, Toomey TP, Powell JT, Brew K, Awad WM Jr.

We described earlier the facilitated purifications of the trypsin and
aminopeptidase components present in Pronase (Vosbeck, K. D., Chow, K. -F., and
Awad, W. M., Jr. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6029-6034). A partially resolved
protein mixture left over after one of the steps in that procedure was passed
through a Sephadex G-75 column. By this means, a component with carboxypeptidase 
activity was separated from associated serine endopeptidases. Further
purification of this exopeptidase to apparent homogeneity was acheived by
refiltration through the same Sephadex column and by CM-cellulose chromatography.
A single protein band was observed after acrylamide gel electrophoresis; analysis
by sedimentation equilibrium using the meniscus depletion method gave a molecular
weight of 30,300. This enzyme demonstrates activity against
Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonylglycyl-L-leucine and hippuryl-D,L-phenyllactate; no
activity was found against Nalpha-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester,
Nalpha-benzoyl-D,L-arginine-p-nitroanilide, or L-leuckne-p-nitroanilide. The
maximum activity lies between pH values of 7 and 8; the enzyme is stable between 
pH values of 6 and 10. At room temperature 1,10-phenanthroline inactivates the
enzyme completely whereas EDTA has no effect. Of the many cations tested, only
Co2+, Ni2+, or Zn2+ restores activity to the 1,10-phenanthroline-treated enzyme; 
Co2+ provided 3 times the native activity. The metal in the native protein was
found to be zinc. These findings are similar to those recorded with bovine
pancreatic carboxypeptidase A, and suggest the possibility that the present
enzyme may ge genetically related to the mammalian protein, as in previously
noted examples of homology of three Pronase endopeptidases to pancreatic serine
enzymes.

Trypsin-sensitive photosynthetic activities in chloroplast membranes from
Chlamydomonas reinhardi, y-1.

Regitz G, Ohad I.

Location of electron transport chain components in chloroplast membranes of
chlamydomonas reinhardi, y-1 was investigated by use of proteolytic digestion
with soluble or insolubilized trypsin. Digestion of intact membrane vesicles with
soluble trypsin inactivates the water-splitting system, the
3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea inhibition site of Photosystem II, the
electron transport between the two photosystems as well as the ferredoxin NADP
reductase. Reduction of NADP with artificial electron donors for Photosystem I
could be restored, however, by addition of purified reductase to trypsin-digested
membranes. Electron transfer activities of Photosystems I and II reaction centers
were resistant to trypsin digestion either from outside or from within the
thylakoids when active trypsin was trapped inside the membrane vesicles by
sonication and digestion carried out in the presence of trypsin inhibitor added
from outside. In the latter case, the water-splitting system was also found to be
resistant to digestion. Polyacrylamide-bound insolubilized trypsin inactivated
only the ferredoxin NADP reductase. Photosynthetically active membranes obtained 
at different stages of development showed a basically similar behavior toward
trypsin.

A complex of cardiac cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c.

Chiang YL, Kaminsky LS, King TE.

The interactions of cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c from bovine cardiac
mitochondria were investigated. Cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c formed a 1:1
molecular complex in aqueous solutions of low ionic strength. The complex was
stable to Sephadex G-75 chromatography. The formation and stability of the
complex were independent of the oxidation state of the cytochrome components as
far as those reactions studied were concerned. The complex was dissociated in
solutions of ionic strength higher than 0.07 or pH exceeding 10 and only
partially dissociated in 8 M urea. No complexation occurred when cytochrome c was
acetylated on 64% of its lysine residues or photooxidized on its 2 methionine
residues. Complexes with molecular ratios of less than 1:1 (i.e. more cytochrome 
c) were obtained when polymerized cytochrome c, or cytochrome c with all lysine
residues guanidinated, or a "1-65 heme peptide" from cyanogen bromide cleavage of
cytochrome c was used. These results were interpreted to imply that the complex
was predominantly maintained by ionic interactions probably involving some of the
lysine residues of cytochrome c but with major stabilization dependent on the
native conformations of both cytochromes. The reduced complex was autooxidizable 
with biphasic kinetics with first order rate constants of 6 X 10(-5) and 5 X
U0(-5) s-1 but did not react with carbon monoxide. The complex reacted with
cyanide and was reduced by ascorbate at about 32% and 40% respectively, of the
rates of reaction with cytochrome c alone. The complex was less photoreducible
than cytochrome c1 alone. The complex exhibited remarkably different circular
dichroic behavior from that of the summation of cytochrome c1 plus cytochrome c. 
We concluded that when cytochromes c1 and c interacted they underwent dramatic
conformational changes resulting in weakening of their heme crevices. All results
available would indicate that in the complex cytochrome c1 was bound at the
entrance to the heme crevice of cytochrome c on the methionine-80 side of the
heme crevice.

Leucine aminopeptidase (bovine lens). Effect of pH on the relative binding of
Zn2+ and Mg2+ to and on activation of the enzyme.

Thompson GA, Carpenter FH.

Incubation of leucine aminopeptidase (bovine lens) (EC 3.4.1.1) with various
concentrations of Mg2+ at various pH values in 1 M KCl and 0.155 M
trimethylamine-HCl at 37 degrees confirms that Mg2+ competes with Zn2+ for
binding only 1 site per 54,000-dalton subunit. The ratio of the apparent
association constants (1KZn:1KMg = 1KZn/Mg) at this site (site 1) was estimated
to be 20,720 at pH 8.16, 10,570 at pH 8.44, 3,590 at pH 8.78, and 660 AT PH 9.14.
The decrease in values of 1KZn/Mg with increasing pH in the activation of leucine
aminopeptidase by Mg2+ is attributed to the lowering of the free Zn2+
concentration relative to that of free Mg2+ caused by the formation of ZnOH+ and 
Zn(OH)2 complexes with increasing OH- concentration. When corrections are made
for the binding of Zn2+ by OH- ions, the pH-independent ratio of association
constants (1KZn:1KMg = 1KZn/Mg) for the relative binding of Zn2+ and Mg2+ at site
1 of leucine aminopeptidase in 29,800. From the effect of pH on the relative
binding constant, a value (beta2) for the product of the two stepwise association
constants for the formation of Zn(OH)2 from Zn2+ and OH- (Zn2+ + OH- in
equilibrium ZnOH+; ZnOH+ + OH- in equilibrium Zn(OH)2) was estimated to be 4.42 X
10(10) M-2 at 37 degrees. Values of Km at pH 7.5 AND 30 degrees with L-leucine
p-nitroanilide as substrate in the presence of 0.01 M NaHCO3 are 4.13 and 2.01 mM
for the zinc-zinc and magnesium-zinc enzymes, respectively. Values for Vmax are
0.2 and 2.49 mumol/min/mg, respectively.

Biochemical studies of tast sensation. Binding of L-[3H]alanine to a sedimentable
fraction from catfish barbel epithelium.

Krueger JM, Cagan RH.

Large numbers of taste buds are distributed over the body surface of the channel 
catfish ictalurus punctatus, with the barbels having an especially high density. 
L-Alanine, as well as certain other amino acids, are taste stimuli in this
animal. Epithelial tissue obtained by gentle scraping of the barbel surface was
fractionated by differential centrifugation. A sedimentable fraction (P2) was
prepared that was enriched in L[OH]alanine binding activity, the plasma membrane 
marker enzyme 5'-nucleotidase, and the mitochondrial marker succinate cytochrome 
c reductase, but not the microsomal marker NADH cytochrome c redu.ctase. Binding 
of L-[OH]alanine was measured using a Millipore filter method in which correction
for non-specific binding was also determined. Time, temperature, and pH for
measuring binding activity were established. At the optimal pH of 7.8, the KD for
L-alanine is 4.8 X 10(-6) M. The first order dissociation rate constant at 6
degrees is 3.8 X 10(-4) s-1 and at 24 degrees it is 12.1 X 10(-4) s-1. The second
order rate constant for association is between 10(2) and 10(3) M-1 S-1.
Reversibility of the binding interaction was also demonstrates by the rapid
displacement of bound L-[3H]alanine by a large excess of unlabeled L-alanine.
That the binding does not represent incorporation into protein was confirmed by
the lack of effect of puromycin. The amounts bound of several other
chemostimulatory amino acids werealso determined.

Arterialization of the coronary veins in diffuse coronary arteriosclerosis.

Moll JW, Dziatkowiak AJ, Edelman M, Iljin W, Ratajczyk-Pakalska E, Stengert K.

Since the coronary veins and capillaries are not involved with arteriosclerotic
disease the authors performed experimental, and afterwards, clinical total and
selective coronary vein arterialization. Acute myocardial ischaemia created for
instance by ligation of the anterior descending branch, was treated by an
internal mammary artery to regional coronary vein anastomosis. In 21 patients the
selective arterialization of the "Vena cordis magna" or of "Vena cordis media",
and total arterialization of the coronary sinus was performed. The clinical
improvement and follow-up studies seem to be promising in the treatment of
patients with advanced diffuse heavy coronary arteriosclerosis. In acute
myocardial ischaemia with coronarographically localized coronary occlusion, the
aim of regional vein arterialization is to minimize the area of infarction.

Structure, composition, physical properties, and turnover of proliferated
peroxisomes. A study of the trophic effects of Su-13437 on rat liver.

Leighton F, Coloma L, Koenig C.

Peroxisome proliferation has been induced with
2-methyl-2-(p-[1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl]-phenoxy)-propionic acid (Su-13437).
DNA, protein, cytochrome oxidase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and acid phosphatase
concentrations remain almost constant. Peroxisomal enzyme activities change to
approximately 165%, 50%, 30%, and 0% of the controls for catalase, urate oxidase,
L-alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase, and D-amino acid oxidase, respectively. For
catalase the change results from a decrease in particle-bound activity and a
fivefold increase in soluble activity. The average diameter of peroxisome
sections is 0.58 +/- 0.15 mum in controls and 0.73 +/- 0.25 mum after treatment. 
Therefore, the measured peroxisomal enzymes are highly diluted in proliferated
particles. After tissue fractionation, approximately one-half of the normal
peroxisomes and all proliferated peroxisomes show matric extraction with ghost
formation, but no change in size. In homogenates submitted to mechanical stress, 
proliferated peroxisomes do not reveal increased fragility; unexpectedly,
Su-13437 stabilizes lysosomes. Our results suggest that matrix extraction and
increased soluble enzyme activities result from transmembrane passage of
peroxisomal proteins. The changes in concentration of peroxisomal oxidases and
soluble catalase after Su-13437 allow the calculation of their half-lives. These 
are the same as those found for total catalase, in normal and treated rats, after
allyl isopropyl acetamide: about 1.3 days, a result compatible with peroxisome
degradation by autophagy. A sequential increase in liver RNA concentration,
[14C]leucine incorporation into DOC-soluble proteins and into immunoprecipitable 
catalase, and an increase in liver size and peroxisomal volume per gram liver,
characterize the trophic effect of the drug used. In males, Su-13437 is more
active than CPIB, another peroxisome proliferation-inducing drug; in females,
only Su-13437 is active.

Localization of NADH oxidase on the surface of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes
by a new cytochemical method.

Briggs RT, Drath DB, Karnovsky ML, Karnovsky MJ.

The ultrastructural localization of NADH oxidase, a possible enzyme in the
increased oxidative activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) during
phagocytosis, was studied. A new cytochemical technique for the localization of
H2O2, a product of NADH oxidase activity, was developed. Cerous ions, in the
presence of peroxide, form an electron-dense precipitate. Resting and
phagocytically stimulated PMN were exposed to cerous ions at pH 7.5 to
demonstrate sites of NADH-dependent, cyanide-insensitive H2O2 production. Resting
PMN exhibites slight activity on the plasma membrane; phagocytizing PMN had
extensive deposits of reaction product localized within the phagosome and on the 
plasma membrane. Peroxide involvement was demonstrated by the inhibitory effect
of catalase on cerium precipitation; the surface localization of the enzyme
responsible was confirmed by using nonpenetrating inhibitors of enzymatic
activity. A correlative study was performed with an NADH-dependent,
tetrazolium-reduction system. As with cerium, formazan deposition on the surface 
of the cell was NADH dependent, cyanide insensitive, and stimulated by
phagocytosis. Superoxide dismutase did not inhibit tetrazolium reduction, as
observed cytochemically, indicating direct enzymatic dye reduction without
superoxide interposition. These findings, combined with oxygen consumption
studies on resting and stimulated PMN in the presence or absence of NADH,
indicate that NADH oxidase is a surface enzyme in human PMN. It is internalized
during phagocytosis and retains its peroxide-generating capacity within the
phagocytic vacuole.

Defective lysosomal enzyme secretion in kidneys of Chediak-Higashi (beige) mice.

Brandt EJ, Elliott RW, Swank RT.

The beige mouse is an animal model for the human Chediak-Higashi syndrome, a
disease characterized by giant lysosomes in most cell types. In mice, treatment
with androgenic hormones causes a 20-50-fold elevation in at least one kidney
lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucuronidase. Beige mice treated with androgen had
significantly higher kidney beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase, and
N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (hexosaminidase) levels than normal mice. Other
androgen-inducible enzymes and enzyme markers for the cytosol, mitochondria, and 
peroxisomes were not increased in kidney of beige mice. No significant lysosomal 
enzyme elevation was observed in five other organs of beige mice with or without 
androgen treatment, nor in kidneys of beige females not treated with androgen.
Histochemical staining for glucuronidase together with subcellular fractionation 
showed that the higher glucuronidase content of beige mouse kidney is caused by a
striking accumulation of giant glucuronidase-containing lysosomes in tubule cells
near the corticomedullary boundary. In normal mice lysosomal enzymes are
coordinately released into the lumen of the kidney tubules and appreciable
amounts of lysosomal enzymes are present in the urine. Levels of urinary
lysosomal enzymes are much lower in beige mice than in normal mice. It appears
that lysosomes may accumulate in beige mice because of defective exocytosis
resulting either from decreased intracellular motility of lysosomes or from their
improper fusion with the plasma membrane. A similar defect could account for
characteristics of the Chediak-Higashi syndrome.

Stimulation of 2-deoxy-d-glucose transport in control and virus-transformed cells
by ethidium bromide.

Soslau G, Nass MM.

Recently we demonstrated that ethidium bromide altered the plasma and subcellular
membrane glycoproteins in control and virus transformed cells. It is reported
here that ethidium bromide also stimulated the membrane associated process of
sugar transport. The KM of the virus transformed cells and the ethidium bromide
treated cells is the same as that of the control cells while the maximum velocity
as compared to the control cells is significantly increased. The transport of
2-deoxyl-D-glucose was inhibited by glucose, cytochalasin B and neuraminidase but
was unaffected by variations in cell density or pH of the incubation medium.

Effect of pharmacological agents on human keratinocyte mitosis in vitro. II.
Inhibition by catecholamines.

Harper RA, Flaxman BA.

Catecholamines produce mitotic inhibition in primary cell cultures of human
keratinocytes probably via a block in the G2 part of the cell cycle. Epinephrine 
produced significant mitotic inhibition (49%) at a concentration as low as 4.5 X 
10(-10) M, while its analog, isoproterenol, produced 47% inhibition at 1 X
10(-10) M. Norepinephrine elicited a 49% inhibitory response at 1 X 10(-8) M. One
other catecholamine, dopamine, caused a 53% decrease in mitosis at 1 X 10(-6) M. 
Other structurally related amines to exhibit mitotic inhibition were
phenylephrine, 58% at 1 X 10(-7) M; octopamine, 47% at 1 X 10(-5) M; and
tyramine, 52% at 1 X 10(-4) M. Serotonin showed no mitotic inhibition at 1 X
10(-4) M. Various alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agents were added to the
cell system. The alpha blocking agent, phentolamine, had no effect on mitosis.
When added in conjunction with epinephrine or norepinephrine, no reduction of the
catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition was observed. The beta blocking agent,
propranolol, by itself showed slight mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-6) M. When
added along with epinephrine or noreinephrine, propranolol reduced the
catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition approximately 65%. In addition,
propranolol blocked mitotic inhibition caused by phenylephrine, an alpha
adrenergic agent. However, another beta blocking agent, dichloroisoproterenol,
showed strong mitotic inhibition (53%) when added to the cultures at a
concentration of 1 X 10(-8) M. The effect was reduced to zero in the presence of 
propranolol. These data suggest that while beta receptors may be involved in the 
catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition of human keratinocytes in vitro, the
nature of the receptor-molecule interaction may be complex.

Serum-free growth of HTC cells containing glucocorticoid- and insulin-inducible
tyrosine aminotransferase and cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors.

Thompson EB, Anderson CU, Lippman ME.

HTC cells have been made to grow in chemically defined medium without any
macromolecular supplements whatsoever. Initial estimates of their relative amino 
acid requirements have been made. The cells grown in the defined medium retain
many of the differentiated features which have been the focus of investigation in
their serum-grown counterparts. Thus, the cells in defined medium contain
cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors and have tyrosine aminotransferase which can
be induced by glucocorticoids, serum or insulin. These cells also produce, in
small amounts, an as yet undefined rat serum protein.

Stimulation of lactic acid production in chick embryo fibroblasts by serum and
high pH in the absence of external glucose.

Fodge DW, Rubin H.

Lactic acid production by chick embryo fibroblasts occurs in the absence of
exogenous glucose. Fifteen to 50-fold less lactic acid is formed in the absence
of glucose than in its presence. Nevertheless, serum and pH stimulation enhances 
this residual lactic acid production to the same relative extent as when glucose 
is present. The amount of lactic acid formed cannot be accounted for by the
catabolism of residual glucose in the medium since its concentration is less than
one-tenth that of the lactic acid eventually produced. Moreover, the residual
glucose concentration remains constant or increases during the course of the
experiment. To a large extent lactic acid accumulation in the absence of external
glucose is dependent on the presence of amino acids in the medium, but amino acid
transport is not affected by the stimulatory agents used in this study. The
results suggest that treatments which stimulate cell multiplication also activate
those enzymatic pathways which convert amino acids to pyruvic and thence to
lactic acid.

Isolation and studies of the granules of the amebocytes of Limulus polyphemus,
the horseshoe crab.

Mürer EH, Levin J, Holme R.

Granules were isolated from the cytoplasm of the amebocytes of Limulus
polyphemus, the horseshoe crab, by disruption of cells obtained from blood which 
had been drawn into 2 mM propranolol. The granules subsequently were purified by 
centrifugation through a sucrose gradient that contained heparin. Extracts of the
granules were prepared by freezing and thawing the granule preparations in
distilled water. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy of the granules
revealed round or ovoid particles. However, only one type of granule appeared to 
be present. The ultraviolet spectrum of the extract of amebocyte granules
demonstrated a peak at 277 nm at pH 7.4, and a shift into two peaks of 281 nm and
290 nm at alkaline pH. Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed a pattern similar 
to that observed with lysates prepared from intact amebocytes. Polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, in the presence of urea at pH 4.5, demonstrated patterns similar
to those observed with amebocyte lysate. Extracts of the granules were gelled by 
bacterial endotoxin. The blood of the horseshoe crab contains only one type of
cell, the amebocyte. Previous studies have shown that the blood coagulation
mechanism of Limulus is contained entirely within amebocytes. The current studies
suggest that the granules, which pack the cytoplasm of these cells, contain all
of the factors required for the coagulation of blood, including the clottable
protein. The intracellularly localized coagulation system is released from
amebocytes when their granules rupture during cell aggregation.

Purification of human red cell glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase by affinity

Yoshida A.

Human glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase associated with NADPH was efficiently
bound with agarose-bound NADP, whereas the enzyme associated with NADP was poorly
bound with agarose-bound NADP. After the elimination of haemoglobin from
haemolyzate by treatment with DEAE-cellulose, the enzyme was converted into the
NADPH-bound form and was applied on an affinity column. The enzyme was
specifically eluted from the column by NADP in the elution buffer. A homogeneous 
enzyme preparation was obtained in high yield.

Simultaneous determination of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol in plasma by
mass fragmentography.

Walle T, Morrison J, Walle K, Conradi E.

A quantitative method for the simultaneous determination of propranolol and its
active metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol in human plasma is described. Plasma
samples are extracted at pH 9.6 with ethyl acetate after the addition of sodium
bisulphite and the internal standard oxprenolol. The extracts are derivatized
with trifluoroacetic anhydride before separation on a gas chromatograph--mass
spectrometer. Detection and quantitation of the trifluoroacetyl derivatives are
made by single-ion monitoring. The minimum detectable concentration of
propranolol is 1 ng/ml and of 4-hydroxypropranolol 5 ng/ml using 1-ml plasma
samples. No interferences from normal plasma constituents or from drugs commonly 
prescribed together with propranolol were detected.

Amino acid analysis by ion-exchange chromatography using a lithium elution
gradient. Influence of methanol concentration and sample pH.

Houpert Y, Tarallo P, Siest G.

The separation of amino acids has been achieved on a short column of Chromo-Beads
C2 resin, with a lithium gradient-elution system. The analysis took 8 h. The
separation of asparagine and glutamine from glutamic acid was highly dependent on
the sample pH and on the methanol concentration in the first buffer of the
gradient. The method has been applied to analysis of human plasma and
granulocytes for amino acids.

Determination of 3-(5-tetrazolyl) thioxanthone 10,10-dioxide in human plasma,
urine and faeces.

Bye A, Land G.

A gas chromatographic method is described for assay of 3-(5-tetrazolyl)
thioxanthone 10,10-dioxide (BW 59C) in human plasma, urine and faeces. After
extraction into 1,2-dichloroethane from alkaline medium the compound is converted
to the heptafluorobutyrate derivative which is injected into a gas chromatograph 
and measured using a 63Ni electron capture detector. The assay produces a linear 
calibration curve over the range 0-30 mug/ml when the internal standard method is
used. Reproducibility is good and sensitivity down to 1 ng injected on column is 
possible. The method has been used to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties 
of BW 59C in man and has been semi-automated by the use of an autosampler and
dedicated computer.

Methods to improve detection of pneumococci in respiratory secretions.

Dilworth JA, Stewart P, Gwaltney JM Jr, Hendley JO, Sande MA.

Simple methods to enhance the detection of pneumococci in respiratory secretions 
are needed. Sheep blood agar containing 5 mug of gentamicin per ml was more often
positive (89%) than either standard sheep blood agar (54%) or mouse inoculation
(65%) in recovering pneumococci from 62 adult and pediatric patients. In adults, 
the direct quellung test on sputum smear was a rapid, sensitive method for
predicting subsequent pneumococcal isolation by culture (19 of 20 patients, 95%).
The quellung test and gentamicin plate show improved sensitivity over current
techniques for pneumococcal detection and can be recommended for general use.

Dependence on dose of the acute effects of ethanol on liver metabolism in vivo.

Guynn RW, Pieklik JR.

The dose dependence of the acute effects of ethanol upon liver intermediary
metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in rats. Ethanol was given i.p. in doses
of 0.69, 1.7, and 3.0 g/kg in equal volumes (20 ml/kg). The liver was
freeze-clamped 120 min after injection, and multiple metabolites were measured in
the perchloric acid extract of the tissue. Each group showed a significantly
different pattern of metabolites, redox states, and phosphorylation potentials
although the rate of ethanol disappearance, at least between the two highest dose
groups, was not significantly different. The mitochondrial free [NAD+]/[NADH]
ratios and the cytoplasmic free [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio were paradoxically most
reduced with the lowest dose of ethanol and became progressively more oxidized
with increasing dose. Once established, the differences in these ratios between
the groups tended to persist with time, relatively independent of the
concentration of ethanol. In a somewhat different pattern, the phosphorylation
potential ([ATP]/[ADP][P1]) remained at the control level in the low-dose group
but was significantly elevated in the two higher-dose groups. The results,
therefore, show distinct and complicated dose-dependent patterns of intermediary 
metabolism that cannot be explained completely by any one hypothesis but that
imply significant dose-dependent effects of ethanol upon intermediary metabolism 
not directly related to NADH production.

Factors affecting the solubility of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals.

Bennett RM, Lehr JR, McCarty DJ.

The solubility of triclinic calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals was
measured under varying conditions using 45Ca-labeled crystals, expressing
solubility as micromoles per liter of 45Ca in solution. In a 0.1-M Tris-HC1
buffer pH 7.4, the solubility of accurately sized CPPD crystals (37-20mum) was
60muM with maximal solubility being attained after about 8 h incubation at
37degreeC. Reduction in crystal size, decrease in pH, increase in ionic strength,
Mg++, citrate, and albumin all increased solubility. The most marked effects on
solubility occurred when changing the calcium concentration or by enzymatic
hydrolysis of inoganic pyrophosphate to orthophosphate. It was found that
decreasing the ionized calcium level below 5 mg/100 ml resulted in a progressive 
enhancement of solubility. The observed solubility-enhancing effects of albumin
could be explained solely on its calcium-binding ability and thereby, altered
ionized calcium level. Diffusible calcium in synovial fluid was only 40% of the
total calcium concentration, which means most joint fluids are normally near the 
critical concentration of 5 mg/100 ml of ionized calcium, below which solubility 
is enhanced. During surgery, especially parathyroidectomy, calcium levels fall,
favoring dissolution of CPPD crystals. We speculate that the slight decrease in
crystal size during dissolution frees them from their cartilaginous mold,
resulting in a dose-dependent inflammatory reaction as they are "shed" into the
joint space. Crystal shedding may be reinforced by the modest fall in joint fluid
pH accompanying the inflammatory response.

Lorazepam compared with pentobarbital for nighttime sedation.

Brown PJ, Forrest WH Jr, Brown CR.

Lorazepam (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg) was compared with pentobarbital (60 and 180 mg)
for its effect on sleep in "hospital insomnia." Subjective-response data were
collected by research nurses. Lorazepam was found to be a potent nighttime
sedative: 1 to 1.25 mg of lorazepam is equivalent to 100 mg sodium pentobarbital 
for measures of sleep quality and duration. At this dose level it is less
effective than 100 mg of pentobarbital as a sleep inducer. Studies at higher
doses (up to 4 mg) indicate that lorazepam has a wide therapeutic index.

Evidence from rats that morphine tolerance is a learned response.

Siegel S.

It is proposed that the direct analgesic effect of morphine becomes attenuated
over the course of successive administrations of the narcotic by a conditioned,
compensatory, hyperalgesic response elicited by the administration procedure, the
net result being analgesic tolerance. Using the "hot plate" analgesia assessment 
situation with rats, this conditioning view of tolerance is supported by several 
findings: (a) It is necessary to have reliable environmental cues predicting the 
systemic effects of morphine if tolerance is to be observed, (b) a hyperalgesic
conditioned response may be observed in morphine-tolerant subjects when drug
administration cues are followed by a placebo, and (c) merely by repeatedly
presenting environmental cues previously associated with morphine (but now
presented with a placebo), morphine tolerance can be extinguished.

Murexide for determination of free and protein-bound calcium in model systems.

Sundararajan NR, Whitney RM.

The determination with murexide of free and protein-bound calcium in model
systems of known composition, ionic strength, and pH was investigated. The
spectra of calcium murexide in the presence of varying amounts of calcium ions
indicated that the absorption maximum fo calcium murexide complex occurs at 480
nm while that of murexide ion is at 520 nm. The absorbance at 509 nm is
independent of calcium ion concentration and, therefore, could be used to measure
the total dye. The spectra are pH dependent but constant in the range 6.5 to 7.0.
The apparent dissociation constant of calcium murexide is dependent upon ionic
environment, ionic strength, and free calcium ion concentration. The relationship
between the apparent dissociation constant and free calcium concentration was
established. Whole casein had no effect on the absorption spectra of calcium
murexide and no affinity for calcium murexide complex or murexide ion.
Beta-casein, at the concentrations employed, did not influence the dissociation
fo calcium murexide. At pH 7.0, ionic strength .1, and 2 C, Beta-casein bound
calcium as if there were 8.65 binding sites per molecule, each of pK 2.23,
corresponding to an intrinsic association constant of 168.9 liters per mole.

Effect of trace elements on dissolution of hydroxyapatite by cariogenic
streptococci.

Herbison RJ, Handelman SL.

The effect of low levels of strontium, boron, lithium, molybdenum, and fluorine, 
alone and in combination, on hydroxyapatite solubility, bacterial growth, and
acid production in five antigenic types of Streptococcus mutans was investigated.
Pour plates containing synthetic hydroxyapatite were used to compare dissolution 
of hydroxyapatite. The colonies of the five antigenic types of S mutans produced 
zones of dissolution that were measured. Acid production and growth were studied 
in broth culture media. The results show that low levels of strontium and
fluorine can significantly reduce demineralization of synthetic hydroxyapatite by
S mutans in vitro.

Peroxisome development in the metanephric kidney of mouse.

Goeckermann JA, Vigil EL.

The relationship of enzymatic activity to organelle development and organelle
number during differentiation of the metanephric kidney in the mouse was
approached from several experimental directions. Biochemical analyses of marker
enzymes for peroxisomes (catalase and D-amino acid oxidase), mitochondria
(cytochrome oxidase) and lysosomes (acid phosphatase) were performed on kidneys
at ages from 17 days prenatal to adult. These data were correlated with a
morphometric analysis of populations of peroxisomes and mitochondria in
differentiating cells of the proximal tubule. Postnatal development of the
metanephric kidney was found to be accompanied by a rapid increase in both the
specific activity of catalase and the number of peroxisomes per 100 mu2 in the
proximal tubule during the first 4 weeks of postnatal growth. Elaboration of the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was seen to parallel the increase in number of
peroxisomes to which segments of ER were often in close apposition. Extensive
interactions between segments of ER and peroxisomes were readily visible in
0.5-mu sections viewed in the high voltage electron microscope. In contrast to
peroxisomes, neither mitochondria nor lysosomes followed a similar pattern of net
organelle increase, suggesting that a defined population density of mitochondria 
and lysosomes may exist in the proximal tubule at birth, prior to complete
development of the kidney.

Inhibitory effects of antihistamines and antiserotonins on the bone marrow
reactions produced by Escherichia coli endotoxin in mice.

Hirata M.

The bone marrow reactions (that is, decrease of nucleated cell counts and
increase of red blood cell counts) of mouse bone were observed 1 hr after
injection of endotoxin and peaked after 18 hr. These reactions were significantly
inhibited when diphenhydramine, promethazine (antihistamines), chlorpromazine
(antiserotonin), or cyproheptadine (antihistamine and antiserotonin) was given 30
min before endotoxin. Such bone marrow reactions were also induced with histamine
or serotonin and peaked 1 hr after administration. The histamine-induced changes 
were inhibited by prior treatment with diphenhydramine. These reactions were also
produced by injection of a small amount of both histamine and serotonin, whereas 
no change was found when mice were given a single injection of a larger dose of
histamine or serotonin. These results indicate that histamine and serotonin
released in mice at the initial stage after endotoxin synergistically trigger the
bone marrow reactions, which then continue in the presence of further mediators. 
Antihistamines and antiserotonins are considered to hinder the whole process of
reactions produced by endotoxin.

On the interactions between pancreatic lipase and colipase and the substrate, and
the importance of bile salts.

Borgström B.

The interactions between pancreatic lipase and colipase and the substrate and the
effect of bile salts on these interactions have been investigated by the use of
kinetic experiments and studies on the semiquantitative phase distribution of
lipase and colipase activities. The results suggest that lipase binds to
hydrophobic interfaces with partial irreversible inactivation. Bile salts in the 
range of micellar concentrations and above a pH of about 6.5 displace lipase from
this binding, resulting in a reversible in activation. At pH values below about
6.5, lipase binds strongly to the substrate even in the presence of bile salt,
and a low activity peak is seen around pH 5.5. This is the result of the binding 
of lipase to the "supersubstrate" and the activity of the catalytic site. In the 
presence of bile salt, colipase promotes the binding of lipase to the
"supersubstrate" but not to other hydrophobic interfaces, and catalytic activity 
is reestablished. Kinetic data indicate that the binding between colipase and
lipase in the presence of substrate is strong and occurs in an approximately
stoichiometric relationship.

Effect of ionic strength and ionic composition of assay buffers on the
interaction of thyroxine with plasma proteins.

Sutherland RL, Brandon MR, Simpson-Morgan MW.

When plasma proteins are diluted with buffer the ionic strength and ionic
composition of that buffer affects the interactions between thyroxine (T4) and
its plasma protein-binding sites. Increases in phosphate, chloride or barbiturate
ion concentration from 50 to 200 mmol/l caused a significant decrease in the
affinity of plasma proteins for T4, and a concurrent increase in the
concentration of unbound T4. These results cannot be completely accounted for by 
changes in ionic strength since at the same ionic strength different anions
caused quantitatively different effects on unbound T4 concentration. The degree
of depression of T4 binding by the three anions studied was in the order
barbiturate greater than chloride greater than phosphate. The results of a
systematic study on the composition of diluent buffer systems indicated that when
a 50 mM-sodium phosphate-100 mM-NaCl buffer (pH 7-4) was used as a plasma
diluent, there were unlikely to be gross changes in the T4-binding properties of 
plasma proteins with dilution.

The innervation of the salivary gland of the moth, Manduca sexta: evidence that
dopamine is the transmitter.

Robertson HA.

1. Using the Falck-Hillarp histochemical technique for monoamines, evidence was
found for the presence of a catecholamine in the salivary gland nerves of the
moth, Manduca sexta. 2. The innervation was studied with the electron microscope.
Only the fluid-secreting region of the gland is innervated and the nerve endings 
are characteristic of monoamine-containing terminals. 3. Using a sensitive
enzymatic-isotopic assay for catecholamines, it was found that whole salivary
glands contain 0.33 mug/g dopamine but no noradrenaline. 4. It seems likely that

An electrophysiological analysis of chemoreception in the sea anemone Tealia
felina.

Dawn ID.

1. Electrophysiological techniques have been employed to examine the nature of
the response observed in the ectodermal slow-conduction system (SSI) when
dissolved food substances contact the column of Tealia felina. The response seems
to consist entirely of sensory activity which may continue for periods of many
minutes, provided that the stimulatory chemicals remain contacting the column. 2.
The interval between each evoked pulse gradually increases as the sensory
response progresses. This does not result from fatigue in the conduction system
but involves a genuine process of sensory adaptation. This may occur over a
period of several minutes, which is much longer than comparable adaptation in
higher animals. 3. Physiological evidence suggests that the chemoreceptors
involved are dispersed throughout the column ectoderm and are absent from the
pedal disc, oral disc, tentacles and pharynx. 4. The basic role of the SSI in
coordinating behavioural activity in sea anemones is reviewed. It is concluded
that it functions primarily as a single, diffuse-conducting unit responsible for 
transmitting frequency-coded sensory information from ectodermal chemoreceptors
to ectodermal (and perhaps endodermal) effectors.

The selective eosinophil chemotactic activity of histamine.

Clark RA, Gallin JI, Kaplan AP.

Histamine diphosphate was shown to selectively attract human eosinophils from
mixed granulocyte populations when over 20% eosinophils were used in a modified
Boyden chamber chemotactic assay system. This effect of histamine is abolished by
incubation with diamine oxidase (histaminase) and was generated by
decarboxylation of L-histidine. A linear dose dependent increase in eosinophil
migration was observed between 3 X 10(-7) M and 1.25 X 10(-6) M, while higher
concentrations of histamine inhibited the migration of eosinophils. The
attractant activity of histamine was not inhibited by H-1 or H-2 receptor
antagonists, however, the inhibition of migration observed at higher histamine
concentrations was reversed by metiamine, an H-2 receptor antagonist. The effects
of histamine upon eosinophil migration were demonstrable using three different
assays: (a) counting cells that had traversed 5-mum pore, 12-mum thick
polycarbonate filters, (b) counting cells that had migrated various distances
into a 3-mum pore, 145-mum cellulose nitrate filters, or (c) measuring the number
of cells that had traversed an upper polycarbonate filter and migrated into a
lower cellulose nitrate filter using 15Cr-labeled cells. The ability of histamine
to enhance eosinophil migration was shown to be dependent upon the presence of a 
concentration gradient; histamine did not cause a dose-dependent increase in
random motility. Furthermore, preincubation of the eosinophils with histamine
deactivate the cells to further stimulation by histamine or by C5a. It is
concluded that in low doses histamine is a chemoattractant for human eosinophils,
while in higher doses histamine inhibits eosinophil migration. These observations
may relate to the influx and localization of eosinophils in immediate
hypersensitivity reactions.

Hemoglobins and hemocyanins: comparative aspects of structure and function.

Bonaventura J, Bonaventura C, Sullivan B.

Comparative studies of protein structure and function can be quite interesting by
themselves, and even more interesting when interpreted with respect to an
animal's physiology. In the case of fish hemoglobins, some success in the latter 
has been achieved but there are still many unsolved problems. It appears that
comparative physiology and biochemistry have entered an era where results from
comparative studies can shed a great deal of light on biochemical mechanisms in
general. The trout hemoglobin system is an example. Distinctive hemoglobins in
this system are presently being used as high resolution probes of the
ligand-binding mechanism. Characterization of the multiple, structurally distinct
subunits of the 60S Limulus hemocyanin molecule may similarly aid in
understanding its function. Our studies suggest the possibility of using Limulus 
hemocyanin and other hemocyanins as structural homologs and analogs of more
complex macromolecular arrays. The rapid development of molecular structural data
from X-ray crystallographers combined with the vast data of comparative
physiology and biochemistry makes this one of the most exciting areas in present 
day science.

How do biological systems discriminate among physically similar ions?

Diamond JM.

This paper reviews the history of understanding how biological systems can
discriminate so strikingly among physically similar ions, especially alkali
cations. Appreciation of qualitative regularities ("permitted sequences") and
quantitative regularities ("selectivity isotherms") in ion selectivity grew first
from studies of ion exchangers and glass electrodes, then of biological systems
such as enzymes and cell membranes, and most recently of lipid bilayers doped
with model pores and carriers. Discrimination of ions depends on both
electrostatic and steric forces. "Black-box" studies on intact biological
membranes have in some cases yielded molecular clues to the structure of the
actual biological pores and carriers. Major current problems involve the
extraction of these molecules; how to do it, what to do when it is achieved, and 
how (and if) it is relevant to the central problems of membrane function. Further
advances are expected soon from studies of rate barriers within membranes, of
voltage-dependent ("excitable") conducting channels, and of increasingly complex 
model systems and biological membranes.

Photoreceptor processes: some problems and perspectives.

Goldsmith TH.

Visual photoreceptors from both vertebrates and invertebrates are characterized
by extensive elaboration of membrane which contains visual pigment (rhodopsin).
Visual pigments in all phyla examined are chemically similar: the chromophore is 
11-cis retinaldehyde attached by an aldimine linkage (Schiff base) to a membrane 
protein, opsin. The effect of light is to isomerize the chromophore to the
all-trans configuration. Beyond these fundamental similarities, several specific 
areas are discussed in which variations and differences appear. (1) Light causes 
vertebrate visual pigments to bleach, liberating the chromophore. Most
invertebrate visual pigments do not bleach in the light, but instead form a
thermally stable metarhodopsin, with the chromophore in the all-trans
configuration still attached to the opsin. (2) In the disk membranes of
vertebrate rod and cone outer segments, the rhodopsin molecules are oriented with
their chromophores nearly coplanar with the disks. Within this plane, however,
both rotational and translational diffusion are possible. In the microvillar
membranes of arthropod and cephalopod rhabdoms, on the other hand, the situation 
is less clear. There is evidence for some preferential orientation of
chromophores that implies restrictions on Brownian rotation. (3) In the outer
segments of vertebrate receptors, absorption of light by rhodopsin causes the
plasma membrane to hyperpolarize due to a decrease in sodium conductance,
possibly mediated by calcium ions. In most invertebrate photoreceptors, light
causes a depolarization due to an increase in conductance, principally to sodium 
ions. A subsequent entry of calcium causes a partial repolarization of the
membrane, due to a decrease in sodium conductance. (4) For vertebrate receptors, 
log threshold is directly proportional to the fraction of rhodopsin bleached
(Dowling-Rushton relationship). The proportionality constant varies in different 
preparations from less than four to more than 30, and the physical basis for the 
relationship is unknown. For invertebrates, by contrast, the dependence of
sensitivity on rhodopsin concentration is much less dramatic and may well depend 
simply on the probability of quantum catch. (5) In most species, vertebrate and
invertebrate, the accumulation of photoproduct probably has no effect on membrane
conductance, but several possible exceptions exist. (6) Photoregeneration of
rhodopsin from metarhodopsin is likely an important mechanism of recovery in
certain arthropods such as diurnal insects, but dark mechanisms of recovery also 
exist in all phyla. In no single case are they adequately understood.

Hydrolysis of the hen egg vitelline membrane by cock sperm acrosin and other
enzymes.

Ho JJ, Meizel S.

A technique utilizing Pregnant Mare's Serum Gonadotropin and Human Chorionic
Gonadotropin treatment of hens (Gallus domesticus), followed by manual ovulation 
of the excised follicles, was developed to obtain a large number of mature ova.
The intact ova were used to test whether acrosin, partially purified from the
spermatozoa of the cock (Gallus domesticus), partially purified rabbit testicular
acrosin and commercial preparations of several hydrolytic enzymes could dissolve 
the inner vitelline membrane. Enzymes were applied to pieces of filter paper
placed on the ovum. Cock acrosin and endopeptidases such as trypsin,
chymotrypsin, collagenase and elastase hydrolyzed the membrane whereas
exopeptidases such as leucine aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase A did not.
Phospholipase A, sulfatase, hyaluronidase, beta-glucuronidase and rabbit
testicular acrosin also failed to hydrolyze the membrane. Cock acrosin hydrolysis
of the ovum surface was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor. The surface of
the ovum over the germinal disc region was hydrolyzed more quickly by cock
acrosin than the surface over other regions of the ovum. Acrosin from cock sperm 
caused the release of trichloroacetic acid soluble material absorbing at 280 nm
from sonicated preparations of inner vitelline membranes. Hydrolysis was greatest
at pH 8.0 and was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor.

Some effects of low pH on chloride exchange in human red blood cells.

Gunn RB, Wieth JO, Tosteson DC.

In order to test the range of pH values over which the titratable carried model
for inorganic anion exchange is valid, chloride self-exchange across human red
blood cells was examined between pH 4.75 and 5.7 at 0 decrees c. It was found
that chloride self-exchange flux had a minimum near pH 5 and increased again with
further increase in hydrogen ion activity. The Arrhenius activation energy for
chloride exchange was greatly reduced at low pH values. The chloride flux at pH
5.1 did not show the saturation kinetics reported at higher pH values but was
proportional to the value of the chloride concentration squared. In addition, the
extent of inhibition of chloride self-exchange flux by phloretin was reduced at
low pH. Our interpretation of these findings is that the carrier-mediated flux
becomes a progressively smaller fraction of the total flux at lower pH values and
that a different transport mode requiring two chloride ions to form the permeant 
species and having a low specificity and temperature dependence becomes
significant below pH5. A possible mechanism for this transport is that chloride
crosses red cell membranes as dimers of HCl at these very low pH values.

Ionic properties of the acetylcholine receptor in cultured rat myotubes.

Ritchie AK, Fambrough DM.

The acetylcholine reversal potential (Er) of cultured rat myotubes is -3mV. When 
activated, the receptor is permeable to K+ and Na+, but not to Cl- ions.
Measurement of Er in Tris+-substituted, Na-free medium also indicated a
permeability to Tris+ ions. Unlike adult frog muscle the magnitude of Er was
insensitive to change in external Ca++ (up to 30 mM) or to changes in external pH
(between 6.4 and 8.9). The equivalent circuit equation describing the electrical 
circuit composed of two parallel ionic batteries (EK and ENa) and their
respective conductances (gK and gNa), which has been generally useful in
describing the Er of adult rat and frog muscle, could also be applied to rat
myotubes when Er was measured over a wide range of external Na+ concentrations.
The equivalent circuit equation could not be applied to myotubes bathed in media 
of different external K+ concentrations. In this case, the Er was more closely
described by the Goldman constant field equation. Under certain circumstances, it
is known that the receptor in adult rat and frog muscle can be induced to
reversibly shift from behavior described by the equivalent circuit equation to
that described by the Goldman equation. Attempts to similarly manipulate the
responses of cultured rat myotubes were unsussessful. These trials included a
reduction in temperature (15 degress C), partial alpha-bungarotoxin blodkade, and
activation of responses with the cholinergic agonist, decamethonium.

Effect of cross-reinnervation on physiological parameters and on properties of
myosin and sarcoplasmic reticulum of fast and slow muscles of the rabbit.

Sréter FA, Luff AR, Gergely J.

Cross-reinnvervation of fast (extensor digitorum longus) and slow (soleus) twitch
muscles of the rabbit showed essentially complete fast to slow and slow to fast
conversion, respectively, 11-12 mo after surgery with respect to a number of
physiological parameters including intrinsic shortening, velocity, and isometric 
twitch time to peak. There was pronounced bu incomplete biochemical conversion as
judged by Ca2+ uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum, myosin ATPase, alkali lability, 
and light chain complement. The question of trophic substances of neural origin
is discussed in light of the fact that chronic stimulation for 15 wk of a fast
muscle produces complete biochemical and physiological conversion to the slow
type.

Chitin synthase in Mortierella vinacea: properties, cellular location and
synthesis in growing cultures.

Peberdy JF, Moore PM.

Chitin synthase of Mortierella vinacea was present in the "microsomal' fraction
(100 000 g precipitate), the 'cell-wall' fraction (2000 g precipitate) and the
'mitochondrial' fraction (10 000 g precipitate). The properties of the
'microsomal' enzyme were investigated. The pH optimum was between 5-8 and 6-2,
and the temperature optimum was between 31 and 33 degrees C. The Km for UDP
N-acetyl-D-glucosamine was 1.8 mM. The enzyme was stimulated by Mg2+ and a slight
stimulation was also effected by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Soluble chitodextrins
were inhibitory. A pH-dependent, heat-stable inhibitor of chitin synthase
activity was present in the soluble cytoplasm from the mycelium. The effects of
aeration and glucose concentration on enzyme production in growing cultures were 
also investigated; maximum specific activity of chitin synthase was associated
with the cessation of exponential growth.

Housset P, Nagy M, Schwencke J.

A new method is described for the efficient conversion of Schizosaccharomyces
pombe cells into protoplasts. The following parameters of guanine uptake
determined in whole cells were unchanged in protoplasts: Km value, requirement
for an energy source, sensitivity to competitive inhibitors, pH optimum, as well 
as the typical variation of the initial velocity of uptake observed during the
growth phase.

Manganese mutagenesis in yeast. A practical application of manganese for the
induction of mitochondrial antibiotic-resistant mutations.

Putrament A, Branowska H, Ejchart A, Prazmo W.

When yeast cells were incubated for 4 to 8 h in yeast extract-peptone-glucose
medium, pH 6, containing 8 mM-manganese, and then plated on selective media,
there was a strong induction of antibiotic-resistant mutations. Indirect evidence
suggests that practically all resistant mutants selected were of independent
origin. The analysis of manganese-induced resistant mutants showed that most were
extranuclear, while those tested showed recombination with known mitochondrial
markers. Our results suggest that manganese can be considered as a mutagen which 
specifically induces mitochondrial mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The properties and large-scale production of L-asparaginase from citrobacter.

Bascomb S, Banks GT, Skarstedt MT, Fleming A, Bettelheim KA.

An intracellular L-asparaginase with antitumour activity was purified from a
strain of Citrobacter. The optimum conditions for enzyme production by
fermentation on scales up to 2700 l were investigated. Highest enzyme yield was
obtained in corn-steep liquor medium (9-2%, W/V) at 37 degrees C. Oxygen
limitation was not necessary for high enzyme yield. A total recovery of 4-3% from
nucleic-acid-free extract and a 180-fold increase in specific activity were
obtained after purificaiton. The specific activity of the purified preparation
was 45 i.u./mg protein. The enzyme hydrolysed D-asparagine and L-glutamine at 7
and 5%, respectively, of its activity toward L-asparagine, but L-glutaminase
activity could be demonstrated only at substrate concentrations above 5 mM. The
Km values for L-asparagine and D-asparagine were 2-6 X 10(-5) and 1-4 X 10(-4)
respectively. The anti-lymphoma activity of the enzyme was demonstrated with
Gardner lymphosarcoma and was found only slightly less potent that Crasnitin, the
most active asparaginase so far tested in this system.

Effect of inorganic phosphate on acridine inhibition and plasmid curing in
Escherichia coli.

Nakamura H, Suganuma A, Greenberg J.

Some mutants and stock strains of Escherichia coli K12 were sensitive to
acriflavine in the presence of inorganic phosphate but were resistant to
acriflavine in its absence. They mutated spontaneously to resistance to
acriflavine plus phosphate. The synergistic effect of phosphate on acriflavine
sensitivity was increased at high pH values. Genetic analysis suggested that the 
mutations occurred in the gene acrA. Electron microscopic observation suggested
that the presence of acriflavine plus phosphate affected the structure of the
plasma membrane and the cytoplasm under it. This structural alteration was not
caused by acriflavine alone. Acridine orange plus phosphate can more effectively 
eliminate the plasmid F8-gal+ than acridine orange alone.

Oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane by Pseudomonas methanica.

Ferenci T, Strom T, Quayle JR.

The oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane by suspensions and ultrasonic
extracts of Pseudomonas methanica was studied. A continuous assay for the
oxidation of CO to CO2 was devised, using O2 and CO2 electrodes in combination.
Stoicheiometries of CO-dependent CO2 formation, O2 consumption and NADH
oxidation, and the partial stoicheiometries of methane-dependent NADH oxidation, 
suggest the involvement of a mono-oxygenase in these oxidations. Evidence is
presented suggesting methane and CO oxidation are catalysed by a single enzyme
system, distinct, at least in part, from the NADH oxidase present in extracts.
Ethanol was able to provide the reductant necessary for CO oxidation by cell
suspensions, though the metabolism of ethanol by P. methanica was found unlikely 
to result in substrate-level formation of NADH; the means whereby alcohol
oxidation could supply reductant for the mono-oxygenase are discussed.

Systematic desensitization to reduce dream-induced anxiety.

Cavior N, Deutsch AM.

A modified version of systematic desensitization was used to reduce the anxiety
and negative interpersonal consequences produced by a recurrent aversive dream
resulting from events in the real world. The subject, a 16-year-old incarcerated 
male, was first taught a standard relaxation technique. The subject's dream was
divided into 12 hierarchical imaginal scenes. Following initial relaxation, each 
scene was sequentially introduced and followed by the therapist's suggestion that
the subject was still very relaxed. After three sessions with the therapists and 
several practice sessions by himself, the subject reported no further anxiety to 
the dream (which continued to occur) and improved relations with the
institutional staff. Six months of follow-up showed no recurrence of the anxiety 
or the subsequent irritability which the subject had initially reported as
leading to negative interpersonal relations with the staff.

Experimental evaluation of the spasmogenicity of dopamine on the basilar artery.

White RP, Hagen A, Robertson JT.

Arteriograms of the basilar artery reveal that dopamine given intracisternally to
dogs can generate cerebral vasospasm. This finding supports a recent hypothesis
of others that dopamine may play a role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm,
especially since many substances are known which fail to produce such spasm.
Compared to blood or prostaglandin E2, however, the spasm induced by dopamine was
delayed in onset, less in incidence, and usually less intense. Possible
explanations for such experimental differences are discussed.

Fatty acid and ketone body metabolism in the rat: response to diet and exercise.

Askew EW, Dohm GL, Huston RL.

This study was designed to measure the response of key enzymes of ketone body
metabolism in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver to diet and exercise, two
conditions known to influence ketone body utilization. A 3 (diet: control, high
fat, or high carbohydrate) X 2 (kill condition: rested or exhausted) X 2
(training: trained or untrained) factorial design was used to estimate main
experimental effects as well as identify significant interactions of the
variables. Physical training (treadmill running) was associated with a doubling
of the activity of skeletal muscle 3-oxoacid CoA transferase, a key enzyme in
extrahepatic ketone body utilization. The activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of
liver ketone body production, hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA synthetase (HMG CoA
synthetase), was not greatly influenced by training or exhuastive exercise
indicating that the metabolic control of the ketosis of exercise may more likely 
be a function of the supply of fatty acids to the liver rather than the activity 
of HMG CoA synthetase. Feeding a high fat diet, on the other hand, significantly 
increased the activity of liver HMG CoA synthetase, indicating that the ketosis
of fat feeding may be of a different nature than that of exercise. The results of
this study indicate that physical training is associated with biochemical
adaptations in ketone body metabolism as well as fatty acid oxidation, and that
trained individuals are metabolically better endowed to benefit from the ketosis 
of exercise than untrained individuals.

Some mechanisms of reduction of carotenoid levels in chickens infected with
Eimeria acervulina or E. tenella.

Ruff MD, Fuller HL.

The levels of plasma carotenoids were markedly reduced in broiler cockerels
infected with Eimeria acervulina or E. tenella. The mechanisms of this
depigmentation differed between the two species, being primarily associated with 
interference of absorption of xanthophyll (carotenoids) from the intestinal lumen
with E. acervulina infection and with leakage through the damaged wall of the
cecum with E. tenella infection. Chicks reared on an essentially carotenoid-free 
diet and inoculated with E. acervulina showed no detectable levels of carotenoids
in the blood 48 hours after being changed to a diet containing 30 mg of
xanthophyll/kg. Conversely, uninoculated chicks and chicks inoculated with E.
tenella showed significant and similar increases in plasma levels of carotenoids.
Chicks reared on a diet containing xanthophyll and inoculated with E. tenella
showed a more rapid decrease in plasma carotenoids than did uninoculated controls
when changed to a xanthophyll-free diet. In chicks fed high xanthophyll diets
containing chromic oxide, no indication of malabsorption was seen in chicks
infected with E. tenella compared with uninoculated controls, whereas chicks
inoculated with E. acervulina showed significantly less xanthophyll absorption.
Conversely, a marked increase in the xanthophyll : Cr2O3 ratio was observed in
the cecal contents of chicks inoculated with E. tenella compared with
uninuoculated controls or those inoculated with E. acervulina. Studies of
uninoculated chicks pair-fed with chicks inoculated with E. acervulina or E.
tenella indicated that the decrease in plasma carotenoids and increases in
intestinal pH are not associated with the reduced intake of feed associated with 
infection. The studies involving uninoculated birds with reciprocal chagnes
between high and low xanthophyll diets indicated that plasma carotenoids are a
more rapid and sensitive means of measuring changes in pigmentation levels than
are visual skin scores carotenoid levels from the skin.

Metabolic studies on the development of ethanol-induced fatty liver in KK-Ay
mice.

Arakawa M, Taketomi S, Furuno K, Matsuo T, Iwatsuka H.

Mechanisms involved in the development of the alcoholic fatty liver in KK-Ay mice
were investigated. Incorporation studies using [14C]acetate and [3H]palmitate
indicated that the half-life of hepatic triglycerides was doubled in the
ethanol-ingesting mice, and utilization of the exogenous fat was significantly
increases as compared with that of the control. No persistent alteration was
recognized in hepatic oxidation of palmitate, as estimated by in vitro
experiments using liver slices obtained from control and ethanol-drinking mice.
Enzymic studies indicated that the activities of acetyl COA carboxylase, ATP
citrate lyase, malic enzyme, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were increased 
with ethanol drinking. The increment in hepatic triglycerides accumulated during 
ethanol ingestion was largely accounted for by palmitoleic, oleic, and linoleic
acids. These findings demonstrated an augmentation in hepatic lipogenesis as well
as an increased utilization of exogenous fats. Ethanol drinking did not cause any
appreciable change in plasma triglyceride level and metabolism of adipose tissue.
In summary of the present studies, accelerated lipogenesis and increased
utilization of the dietary fats may be possible causal factors in the alcoholic
fatty liver of KK-Ay mice.

Renal response to acid loading in the developing lamb fetus, intact in utero.

Daniel SS, Bowe ET, Lallemand R, Yeh MN, James LS.

Response of the fetal kidney to metabolic acidosis was studied in five fetal
lambs, 115-125 days gestation, in order to evaluate the renal contribution to
elimination of hydrogen ion during intra-uterine development. Experiments were
conducted on healthy unanesthetized fetuses, intact in utero, with catheters
implanted at hysterotomy into a fetal femoral artery and vein and into the
bladder via the urachus, four or more days prior to the study. A metabolic
acidosis was induced by infusion of isotonic lactic acid, 15 m mole/kg,
intravenously over a period of 90 minutes. Serial arterial samples were taken and
urine collected in fractions before, during and for three hours following the
infusion, for measurements of pH, bicarbonate, lactate and electrolytes as well
as urine output. During the infusion, urine pH fell from 6.65 to 6.25 and was
6.34 three hours later (Figs. 1 to 4, Tabs. III to IV). Lactic acid infusion
caused a prompt increase in urine output from a mean rate of 0.12 to a maximum of
0.28 ml/kg/min at the end of the infusion, returning to control rates three hours
later. Lactate excretion increased from 0.05 to a maximum of 4.6 mumole/kg/min at
the end of infusion; titratable acid increased from 0.22 to a maximum of 4
muEq/kg/min; the rates of excretion of lactate and titratable acid were still
higher than control at the end of three hours. Ammonia excretion increased from
0.21 to a maximum of 0.56 muEq/kg/min three hours after the end of infusion. The 
acid infusion caused a small but significant fall in excretion of bicarbonate.
During the 90 minutes of infusion and over the following three hours, about 800
mumole lactate was excreted while net acid excretion over the same period was no 
more than half that amount. The diuresis was also accompanied by a net loss of
sodium and chloride, the excretion of these ions increasing more than threefold
following acid infusion; excretion of potassium decreased to one-third its rate
prior to the infusion. During the 90 minutes of infusion, blood pH fell from 7.36
to 7.13, base deficit rose from 3.8 to 16.4 mEq/L and lactate rose from 2.2 to
14.8 mM/L; there was also a small but significant rise in both blood PCO2 and PO2
(Figs. 1 to 2, Tabs. I to II). During the following three hours of recovery, pH
rose gradually to 7.29, base deficit and lactate fell to 7.4 mEq/L and 8.7 mM/L
respectively. Since renal excretion of net acid and lactate was small, the
decrease in blood base deficit and lactate levels during the recovery must
therefore be mainly due to equilibration in various fetal compartments as well as
placental transfer. These experiments indicate that, in the lamb fetus, intact in
utero, the kidney although limited by immaturity of several mechanisms, is
capable of responding to an acid load and thus can make a small contribution to
fetal homeostasis. The increase in excretion of net acid is accompanied by loss
of sodium and chloride in the urine.

Recognition and significance of maternogenic fetal acidosis during intensive
monitoring of labor.

Roversi GD, Canussio V, Spennacchio M.

FHR monitoring and microanalysis of fetal blood are mutually complementary
procedures, and optimal knowledge of the fetal state is achieved by making use of
both, the former for the preliminary screening of all cases at risk and the
latter for the purpose of deciding on obstetric management where pathological
changes are evident in the FHR. The major difficulty in obtaining a precise value
for the fetal acid-base balance lies in the occurence of "falsely abnormal"
cases, i.e. cases in which the fetal pH falls during labor but the clinical
condition at birth is good (APGAR greater than or equal to 7). In our own series 
the incidence of such cases among fetuses at risk was 11.2% (Tab. I). In the
majority of these cases the fetal acidosis is thought to be a result of increased
metabolic acidosis in the mother (maternogenic fetal metabolic acidosis). The
importance of the maternogenic fetal acidosis during labor lies in the fact that 
unless it is recognised, rapid extraction of the fetus will appear necessary on
clinical grounds, although it is in fact unnecessary, since this form of acidosis
has no adverse effect on the fetus. Various parameters have been proposed for the
differential diagnosis of the maternogenic fetal acidosis. These include the
feto-maternal difference in base deficit (F/M deltaBD), the materno-fetal
differences in pHqu 40 (M/F deltapHqu 40) the materno-fetal difference actual pH 
(M/F actual deltapH), and the materno-fetal difference in base deficit of the
extra-cellular fluid (M/F deltaBDHb5). A critical analysis of these parameters
has been carried out on the results of microtests performed during a 5 year
period (1968-1972) at the First Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Milan
University. The cases comprised 59 regarded as normal (normal course of
pregnancy, spontaneous commencement of labor at term, clear amniotic fluid,
regular FHR, spontaneous birth, APGAR at 90 sec between 8 and 10, weight at birth
greater than 2500 g), and 335 considered to be at risk (maternal disease,
presence of meconium stained amniotic fluid and/or abnormal changes in FHR). In
all of these cases the FHR was recorded by cardiotokography, and the tracings
were interpreted according to HON. Microsamples of blood were taken from both
mother and fetus during labor and the following determinations were carried out: 
actual pH, pHqu 40, Hb concentration, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, base deficit 
Hb5 (BDHb5). The maternofetal differences were then calculated. The same
determinations were carried out on samples of maternal blood and of arterial and 
venous cord blood taken immediately after delivery. The clinical condition of the
infant was evaluated by the APGAR score at 90 seconds after birth.

Solubilization and stabilization of the cytotoxic agent coralyne.

Cho MJ, Repta AJ, Cheng CC, Zee-Cheng KY, Higuchi T, Pitman IH.

Kinetic studies were carried out on the ring opening of the quaternary nitrogen
cation, coralynium ion (I), to yield 6'-acetylpapaverine (III), on the
cyclization of III to yield I, and on a photochemical reaction undergone by I in 
aqueous solutions exposed to visible light. From the results, it was concluded
that: (a) I and III are in facile equilibrium in aqueous solution but appreciable
amounts of III do not exist in dilute solutions with pH values below 10: (b) the 
photochemical reaction of I in water (presumably a photohydration) can be
reversed by lyophilization, by heatiing, and by increasing the pH of solutions to
values greater than 12; (c) the photochemical reaction of I can be inhibited by
protecting the aqueous solutions from visible light, and the rate in the presence
of light can be reduced by increasing the concentration of I in the solution; and
(d) although the chloride and sulfoacetate salts of I react identically and have 
similar solubilities in water, it is possible to prepare more concentrated and,
hence, more stable solutions of the sulfoacetate salt by including sodium
hydroxide in the solvent. The solubility of coralyne chloride remains about the
same in dilute sodium hydroxide as in water.

Solvolysis of a substituted imidazoline, mazindol.

Maulding HV, Turi P, Grossman D, Nazareno JP.

Hydrolysis of mazindol to form
2-(2-aminoethyl)-3-(p-chlorophenyl)-3-hydroxyphthalimidine was followed
spectro-photometrically in aqueous solutions at temperatures between 37 and
70degree, pH values up to 7.6, and an ionic strength of 0.2. The effects of
acetate, formate, and phosphate buffers as well as ionic strength on the observed
rate constants were investigated. An interesting nonlinear dependency of the kobs
with buffer concentration was noted. The velocity constants declined with
increasing hydrogen-ion concentration; the log k-pH profile and rate law are
given along with other relevant data.

Complexation in formulation of parenteral solutions: solubilization of the
cytotoxic agent hexamethylmelamine by complexation with gentisic acid species.

Kreilgård B, Higuchi T, Repta AJ.

The apparent solubility of hexamethylmelamine in aqueous solutions suitable for
intravenous use was increased by complexation with gentisic acid. Studies were
carried out in the pH 0-8 range. Unprotonated hexamethylmelamine did not form
complexes with the gentisate ion, while the hexamethylmelammonium ion appeared to
form several different complexes with both the gentidate ion and gentisic acid.
Two different solid complexes were isolated and characterized. The solubility
increases observed at pH 3.5-5.0 are described by mathematical relationships
involving the stability constants of some postulated complex species. From these 
results, sultable formulations for use as parenteral solutions are proposed. The 
increase in the apparent aqueous solubility of hexamethylmelamine in such
formulations may range from five- to 90-fold, depending upon the pH and total
gentisateion concentrations.

Inhibitory effect of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate on trypsin activity.

Jodhka GS, Gouda MW, Medora RS, Knalil SA.

The inhibitory effect of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate on the proteolytic
activity of trypsin was investigate over the pH 6-8 range. The antitryptic
activity was determined using two different substrates: casein and
N,alpha-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide hydrochloride. The mechanistic studies
revealed the substrate-inhibitor interaction to be the overall major mechanism of
inhibition. This interaction was shown to involve substrate depletion, probably
involving some primary sites of the natural substrate casein. Some inhibition was
also shown to be due to an interaction between the enzyme and the inhibitior
molecules. The interactions of the inhibitor with the enzyme and the substrate
were irreversible. The possible therapeutic significance of the inhibitory effect
of the surfactant is discussed.

In vitro adsorption of diphenoxylate hydrochloride on activated charcoal and its 
relationship to pharmacological effects of drug in vivo. I.

Sanvordeker DR, Dahani EZ.

The adsorption of diphenoxylate hydrochloride, a potent antidiarrheal agent, on
activated charcoal powder was studied in vitro. Langmuir adsorption isotherms
were established at pH 4 and 7, and the maximum adsorption capacity of charcoal
for this drug was estimated using these values. Activated charcoal modified the
bioavailability of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in vivo. The antipropulsive action
of diphenoxylate in the mouse was strongly inhibited in the presence of activated
charcoal. A comparative evaluation of charcoal and chromium oxide used as inert, 
nonabsorbable markers revealed that chromium oxide may be the marker of choic in 
GI transit studies in laboratory animals since it does not influence the
bioavailability of diphenoxylate hydrochloride.

Binding of bile acids to cholestyramine at gastric pH conditions.

Lindenbaum S, Higuchi T.

The binding of bile salts to cholestyramine was studied under varying conditions 
of pH and added electrolyte. The taurine-conjugated bile salts were strongly
absorbed by the anion-exchange resin at low pH and in the presence of chloride
anions. Glycocholic acid binding was very weak at low pH but increased strongly
with increasing pH. The presence of chloride ions strongly decreased the amount
of glycocholate bound by the anion-exchange resin.

Amodiaquin accumulation by mouse erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium berghei.

Fitch CD, Gonzalez Y, Chevli R.

[14C]amodiaquin accumulation by washed erythrocyte preparations was characterized
to permit comparisons with chloroquine accumulation. Erythrocytes infected with
Plasmodium berghei CS (chloroquine-susceptible) accumulate amodiaquin by a
saturable process that has an apparent dissociation constant for amodiaquin of
7.6 X 10(-8) M and is competitively inhibited by chloroquine, quinine and
quinacrine, as is the process of chloroquine accumulation. Within experimental
error, the K1 of 8 X 10(-7) M estimated for chloroquine is the same regardless of
whether the drug being accumulated is [14C]amodiaquin or [14C]chloroquine.
Likewise, the K1 for amodiaquin is the same regardless of which drug is being
accumulated. In addition, glucose stimulates and hydrogen ion, cold or
interruption of glycolysis inhibits amodiaquin as well as chloroquine
accumulation. These findings are evidence that a single process serves to
accumulate both drugs. In the absence of substrate, erythrocytes infected with P.
berghei CR (chloroquine-resistant) accumulate twice as much amodiaquin as
chloroquine, and they accumulate more amodiaquin than do erythrocytes infected
with P. berghei CS. These differences occur because P. berghei CR infects
polychromatophilic erythrocytes possessing a high-affinity, substrate-independent
process of accumulation to which amodiaquin has greater access than chloroquine. 
In the presence of glucose, amodiaquin accumulation by erythrocytes infected with
P. berghei CR, when plotted as a function of amodiaquin concentration in the
medium, describes a sigmoid curve.

The neurochemistry of Parkinson's disease: effect of L-dopa therapy.

Lloyd KG, Davidson L, Hornykiewicz O.

Post-mortem brain material from control and Parkinson's disease patients was
examined to elucidate further the neurochemistry of this disease and to determine
the mechanism of action of L-dopa as a therapeutic agent. The activities of
L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (dopa D), tyrosine hydroxylase, monoamine
oxidase and catechol-O-methyl transferase were examined; in addition the tissue
levels of dopa, 3-O-methyldopa, dopamine (DA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were
determined. In the non-dopa-treated Parkinsonian patients, the greatest decreases
were detected for striatal DA and dopa D, with homovanillic acid and tyrosine
hydroxylase levels showing a lesser change. The activities of monoamine oxidase
and catechol-O-methyl transferase in the striatal nuclei were not different from 
the controls. The putamen was consistently the most severely affected region.
Dopa and 3-O-methyldopa were detectable in all brain areas only in those patients
treated with L-dopa shortly before death. The mean concentrations of DA in the
striatum of these patients were 1) 9 to 15 times higher than those in
non-dopa-treated patients, 2) related to the time before death of the last dose
of L-dopa and 3) greater in the striatum of patients clinically classified as
"good responders" as compared to "poor responders." Although L-dopa therapy
increased homovanillic acid levels in all brain areas, a preferential increase
was observed in the striatum. It was concluded that L-dopa's principal
therapeutic effects in Parkinson's disease are consistent with its transformation
to DA in the striatum.

Studies on the mechanism of depletion of striatal dopamine by
alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine.

Uretsky NJ, Snodgrass SR, Lorenzo AV.

These experiments were designed to study the mechanism of depletion of dopamine
(DA) in the striatum produced by alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine (alpha-MMT).
alpha-Methyl-m-tyramine (alpha-MMTA), the metabolite of alpha-MMT, appears to be 
the active DA-depleting agent, since the administration of a decarboxylase
inhibitor before alpha-MMT markedly reduced both the formation of alpha-MMTA and 
the depletion of DA. After injection of alpha-MMT (100 mg/kg i.p.), the striatal 
concentration of homovanillic acid (HVA) rose by 41% at 1 hour. This is probably 
due to an increase in DA metabolism, since alpha-MMT markedly enhanced the
decline of DA produced by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT). At 2, 3 and 4
hours after alpha-MMT, the concentration of HVA and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid
was below control level. The decrease in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid is due
partially to a decreased formation of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid from DA. In
striatal slices, both alpha-MMT and alpha-MMTA decreased the formation of 3H-H2O 
and the accumulation of 3H-DA from 1-3,5-3H-tyrosine. Alpha-MMT did not alter the
specific activity of 3H-tyrosine or release 3H-DA from the slices, but it did
inhibit the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in striatal homogenates at low
concentrations of tyrosine (10 muM). Alpha-MMTA released both newly synthesized
and exogenously accumulated 3H-DA from striatal slices. At low concentrations of 
alpha-MMTA, the percent reduction in 3H-H2O was much greater than the percentage 
of 3H-DA released into the medium. However, at higher concentrations, the
inhibition of 3H-H2O reached a maximum while 3H-DA release kept increasing. These
results suggest that both inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity and DA
release from storage sites by alpha-MMTA may account for the depletion of DA
produced by the injection of alpha-MMT.

Characteristics of gastric inhibition by acidification of oxyntic gland area.

Konturek SJ, Obtulowicz W, Tasler J.

1. Gastric acid responses to the test meals were measured in the Heidenhain
pouch, gastric and pancreatic fistula dogs, using the intragastric titration
method, and monitoring the rate at which a solution of 1-0 N-NaOH had to be added
to maintain the pH of the gastric content constant at pre-selected values ranging
from 5-0 to 1-0. In this way the pH profile of the gastric acid and pepsin
responses to a liver extract meal kept in the Heidenhain pouch or gastric fistula
as well as to exogenous stimuli such as histamine, pentagastrin or Urecholine
could be determined. 2. A liver extract meal adjusted to pH 5-0 produced a potent
and pressure-related stimulation of acid secretion from the Heidenhain pouch
without any change in secretion from the main stomach and pancreas or in the
serum concentration of immuno-assayable gastrin. 3. Graded decrease of the liver 
extract meal pH to below 5-0 resulted in the pH-dependent inhibition of gastric
acid output, which at pH 1-0 was only about 30% of the value attained at pH 5-0. 
Acid secretion from the Heidenhain pouch induced by exogenous stimuli such as
histamine, pentagastrin or Urecholine also showed gradual decrease when the pH of
the pouch content was decreased in sequential order from 5-0 to 1-0. This
pH-dependent inhibition was accompanied by an increase in pepsin secretion. 4.
The pH-dependent inhibition of the Heidenhain pouch response to the liver extract
meal was not altered by topical application of a local anaesthetic and atropine
or by the intravenous infusion of large doses of atropine, secretin or metiamide,
which were shown to cause a marked inhibition of the main stomach response to the
liver meal. 5. The results indicate that there is a local and gastrin-independent
inhibition mechanism of gastric acid secretion activated by an acidified meal
making contact with the oxyntic gland area.

The influence of pH on equilibrium effects of tetrodotoxin on myelinated nerve
fibres of Rana esculenta.

Ulbricht W, Wagner HH.

1. The experiments were done on single nodes of Ranvier of Rana esculenta. The
effects of tetrodotoxin and H ions were determined either by the reduction of the
maximum rate of rise, VA, of action potentials evoked with threshold stimuli or
in the voltage clamp by the decrease of the peak Na permeability, PNa. 2. With
the tetrodotoxin sample used throughout the investigation the equilibrium
dissociation constant, KT, of the toxin-receptor reaction at neutral pH was
determined to be 2-8 nM. Between 1-55 and 15-5 nM tetrodotoxin the normalized
value, A, of VA, was found to be related to the normalized toxin concentration cT
= [TTX]/2-8 nM by the empirical equation log [(1-A)/A] = 1-22 log cT-0-573. 3. On
increasing the pH (up to 8-8) the effect of tetrodotoxin diminished as revealed
by an increase in A. The apparent reduction of cT (as calculated from A) suggests
that the toxin is active only in its cationic forms. 4. Weakly acid tetrodotoxin 
solutions (7-3 less than pH less than or equal to 5-5) reduced A to a lesser
degree than did neutral toxin solutions in spite of the inherent depressing
effect of acid pH on A (A = 0-5 at about pH 5-5). In more acid toxin solutions A 
decreased again and at pH 4-6 it was about equal to the value in toxin-free
solution. 5. When, after equilibrium in an acid toxin solution, the perfusate was
suddenly changed to neutral Ringer solution A jumped to a higher value A' as
measured 1 sec after the switch. Since the blocking effect of hydrogen ions
subsided within a fraction of a second while the time constant of the toxin
washout is of the order of 1 min, A' reflects the number of Na channels blocked
by tetrodotoxin at acid pH. 6. In acid toxin-free solution the peak PNa as
obtained in voltage clamp experiments was reduced by a voltage-dependent factor
(cH + 1)-1 with CH = [H+]/KH(E) and KH(E) = 2-04 muM exp (0-34 EF/RT). Adding
tetrodotoxin resulted in another reduction by a constant factor p'T. 7.
Experiments employing various combinations of toxin concentration (3-1-93 nM) and
pH values (7-3-5-2) confirm the decreased toxin effect at low pH. Moreover, p'T
was smaller (the additional toxin effect larger) when the membrane had been kept 
depolarized and thus cH reduced during equilibration. This suggests that
tetrodotoxin cations and H ions compete for the same blocking site. A
quantitative fit, however, requires additional assumptions.

The influence of pH on the rate of tetrodotoxin action on myelinated nerve
fibres.

Ulbricht W, Wagner HH.

1. The experiments were done on single myelinated nerve fibres of Rana esculenta.
The rates of toxin effect were studied either by measuring the maximum rate of
rise, VA, of repetitively evoked action potentials or by measuring Na currents
during periodic impulses in the voltage clamp. 2. VA measurements showed that in 
alkaline solutions (pH up to 8-8) the offset rate was unchanged while the onset
was slowed in quantitative agreement with an assumed decrease in the active
cationic form of tetrodotoxin. 3. Both VA measurements and those in the voltage
clamp revealed a decrease in T'off, the offset time constant and in increase in
the onset time constant, T'on, as the pH was lowered. 4. For tetrodotoxin
concentrations, [TTX], up to 400 nM and pH values down to 5-3 the simple relation
T'on/T'off = p'R held, where p'T is the constant factor by which the Na
permeability was reduced at equilibrium with a given [TTX]. 5. The agreement
between kinetic and equilibrium results was also valid when, at constant [TTX]
and pH. p'T was modified by the holding potential during equilibration. 6. No
unequivocal explanation of the results can be given but some of their features
resemble acid catalysis.

The formation of synapses in amphibian striated muscle during development.

Bennett MR, Pettigrew AG.

1. A study has been made of the formation of synapses in developing reinnervated 
and cross-reinnervated amphibian twitch muscles which receive either a focal
(iliofibularis) or a distributed (sartorius) innervation from 'en plaque' nerve
terminals using histological, ultrastructural and electrophysiological
techniques. 2. During the development of the tadpole through metamorphosis to the
adult frog, the sartorius myofibres increased in length at about twice the rate
of the iliofibularis myofibres, due to a fast rate of growth at their insertions 
on to the pelvic tendon. 3. The short iliofibularis and sartorius myofibres of
young tadpoles (800 mum long) possessed only a single synapse and the
iliofibularis myofibres did not receive any further innervation during
development. However the sartorius myofibres received further transient
innervation on the new muscle laid down during development at the fast growing
pelvic insertion, until the distance between the original synapse formed on the
myofibres and the synapse at the pelvic end of the muscle was about 12 mm. 4.
During development synapses possessed either skewed, multimodal, or unimodal
m.e.p.p. amplitude-frequency distributions; the intervals between m.e.p.p.s. were
not distributed randomly according to a Poisson process, as m.e.p.p.s. of similar
amplitudes tended to be separated by very short intervals; the unit-size e.p.p.
had a similar amplitude-frequency distribution as the m.e.p.p.s. if these had a
unimodal distribution. 5. Reinnervation or cross-reinnervation of the sartorius
and the iliofibularis muscles in adults or at a late stage of development simply 
reconstituted the normal focal and distributed innervation patterns of the
muscles, as found in the control muscles of the contralateral and unoperated
legs. 6. These observations on synapse formation in amphibia are consistent with 
the hypothesis that during development the axon making the initial synaptic
contact on the muscle cells induces a property over a length of muscle membrane
adjacent to this site which makes it refractory to synapse formation; thus during
reinnervation or cross-reinnervation of adult muscles this refractory property
constrains synapse formation to these sites.

Comparative studies of Trypanosoma vespertilionis Battaglia and Trypanosoma
dionisii Bettencourt &amp; França.

Soria CA, Dusanic DG.

In diphasic blood agar media Trypanosoma vespertilionis developed spheroid
clusters as compared to rather long, sausage-shaped (sometimes branched) clusters
formed by Trypanosoma dionisii. The former species attained a greater population 
density (approximately 6 X 10(7) organisms/ml) than the latter (approximately 2 X
10(7) organisms/ml). Greater numbers of epimastigotes, some in active binary
divisions, were observed during the logarithmic phase of growth, and morphologic 
changes occurred during cultivation which correlated with increased acidity and a
depletion of glucose. Maximum numbers of trypomastigote forms were found during
the stationary and early death phases. Most of the forms observed after 20 days
were sphaeromastigotes. Glucose concentrations decreased to 0 M in T.
vespertilionis and to 4.4 X 10(-5) M in T. dionisii cultures during the
stationary and death phases. By the 12th day of incubation cultures of T.
vespertilionis were more acid (pH 5.5) than those of T. dionisii vespertilionis
and T. dionisii contained common and specific antigens. At least 2-3 common
antigens were detected in extracts reacted against heterologous antisera.
Specific antigens were observed as nonidentical lines formed by extracts reacted 
against homologous and heterologous antisera and with antisera absorbed with
heterologous antigens. At least 2 specific antigens were evident in extracts of
T. vespertilionis and 1 in extracts of T. dionisii.

N-Isopropyl derivatives of dopamine and 5,6-dihydroxy-2-aminotetralin.

Cannon JG, O'Donnell JP, Lee T, Hoppin CR, Long JP, Ilhan M, Costall B, Naylor
RJ.

Secondary and tertiary amino homologs of the title compounds have been prepared, 
bearing an N-isopropyl group. In peripheral evaluation, certain members of the
series exhibited beta-adrenergic agonist effects of lower activity than
isoproterenol. N-Methyl-N-isopropyl-5,6-dihydroxytetralin exhibited marked
properties consistent with its being an alpha agonist, and it is concluded that
introduction of considerable bulk about the nitrogen of a catecholamine does not 
a priori destroy alpha-agonist effects. The compounds qualitatively paralleled
the effects of dopamine in assays based upon direct intrastriatal administration 
in rats, although they were less potent than dopamine.

Phospholipases. III. Effects of ionic surfactants on the phospholipase-catalyzed 
hydrolysis of unsonicated egg lecithin liposomes.

Goldhammer AR, Jain MK, Cordes EH.

Apparent values of Km and Vmax have been measured for catalysis of hydrolysis of 
unsonicated egg lecithin liposomes, activated through addition of 0.4 M
n-hexanol, by phospholipases A2 from bee and snake venoms and by phospholipase C 
from Clostridium welchii as a function of the concentration of three surfactants:
hexadecylamine, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, and dihexadecyl phosphate.
For all three enzymes, values of Km and Vmax show little or no dependence on the 
concentration of these ionic surfactants, demonstrating that the liposomal
surface charge is not a crucial factor in determining susceptibility to
phospholipase-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Negative potential level in the outer layer of the toad skin.

Nunes MA, Vieira FL.

The isolated skin of the toad Bufo marinus ictericus when impaled from the outer 
surface by glass microelectrodes filled with 3 M KCl shows a voltage profile
which is a continuous function of the depth of impalement. The superficial
intraepithelial potential difference measured with reference to the external
solution (PDi) is negative with NaCl-Ringer's solution on both sides of the skin,
displaying a minimum of -26.7+/-3.6 mV at 6+/-2 mum. Null value is obtained at
19+/-3 mum, with positive values for deeper impalements. Indications of cell
impalements (abrupt voltage and resistance jumps) were frequently observed at
sites deeper than 25 mum from the outer surface. Measurements of the electrical
resistance between the microelectrode and the external solution, made with
single- and double-barreled microelectrodes, showed great discrepancies, which
may be attributed to distinct pathways of different resistances in the stratum
corneum. PDi measured at a depth of 5 mum was a logarithmic function of Na2SO4 or
K2SO4 concentration in the external solution, increasing in negativity with a
reduction in concentration. Substitution of Na by K in the external solution had 
only minor effects on PDi. Acidification of the external solution from pH 9 is
accompanied by a reduction in the negative value of PDi. At pH 3 PDi was
positive. PDi was interpreted as a diffusion potential at the tip of the
microelectrode due to KCl diffusion from the electrode into the matrix of the
stratum corneum. Differences in K and Cl mobilities, responsible for the origin
of PDi, were attributed to fixed charges in the matrix of the stratum corneum,
with density and polarity determined by their degree of proponation, controlled
by the hydrogen ion concentration of the external solution. Skin potential,
short-circuit current and their relationship to PDI were discussed.

The avian erythrocyte: a study of fixation for electron microscopy.

Brown JN.

The quality of ultrastructural preservation of the avian erythrocyte achieved
using various fixation techniques is evaluated. Different combinations of initial
fixatives, buffers and post-fixation procedures were tested as well as variations
in fixative osmolarity, pH and temperature. Of the commonly used initial
fixatives (glutaraldehyde, acrolein and formaldehyde), 2% glutaraldehyde, alone
in a slightly hypertonic buffer containing divalent ions, produced optimum
erythrocyte preservation. The osmolarity was balanced using a non-electrolyte
such as a sucrose. The addition of 12% hexylene glycol to the buffer solutions
also improves erythrocyte preservation, as evidenced by the increased stability
of the marginal microtubules, microfilaments and proteinaceous material. The use 
of Spurr low-viscosity epoxy resin enables the cells to be collected using low
gravitational centrifugation.

Hemoglobin solution and the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve.

Greenburg AG, Elia C, Levine B, Belsha J, Peskin GW.

1) A study was carried out to determine the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve of
stroma-free hemoglobin solution and factors which influence it, (pH; 2,3 DPG). 2)
To simulate acute volume replacement, dilution experiments, in vitro, were
performed employing both hemoglobin solution and Ringer's lactate in whole blood.
3) It was determined that stroma-free hemoglobin solution has a left-shifted
oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve which responds to pH change but not to the
addition of 2,3 DPG. 4) The dilutional effect of hemoglobin solution when mixed
with whole blood in volumes up to 50% was to left-shift the oxyhemoglobin curve, 
unlike the effect of Ringer's lactate (no change). 5) This may have importance in
the hemodynamic compensatory response to acute normovolemic anemia.

Effect of antihistamine-antiserotonin and ganglionic blocking agents upon
increased capillary permeability following burn trauma.

Carvajal HF, Brouhard BH, Linares HA.

Tiny (0.2% TBS), partial thickness, non-contact radiant heat burns in guinea pigs
resulted, within 3 hours, in significant edema formation and protein leakage at
the site of the injury. Areas of skin distant to the burn also showed an increase
in water content but no protein leakage. Pretreatment of the animals with either 
chlorisondamine hydrochloride or a mixture of methysergide and chlorpheniramine
significantly decreased postburn edema formation and protein leakage. Liquid
emulsion autoradiography revealed that leakage of protein occurs primarily in the
areas of skin adjacent to the panniculus carnosus. The studies suggest that: the 
increase in vascular permeability that occurs as a consequence of burn injuries
is humorally mediated; albumin leakage is limited to the injured tissues; and
histamine, serotonin, and presumably catecholamines play significant roles in the
development of this phenomenon.

Bacteriophage T4 baseplate components. II. Binding and location of
bacteriophage-induced dihydrofolate reductase.

Kozloff LM, Crosby LK, Lute M, Hall DH.

The location of T4D phage-induced dihydrofolate reductase (dfr) has been
determined in intact and incomplete phage particles. It has been found that phage
mutants inducing a temperature-sensitive dfr (dfrts) procude heat-labile phage
particles. The structural dfr produced by these ts mutants was shown to assume
different configurations depending on the temperature at which the phage is
assembled. Morphogenesis of incomplete phage particles lacking the gene 11
protein on their baseplates was found to be inhibited by reagents binding to dfr,
such as antibodies to dfr. Further, cofactor molecules for dfr, such as reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and reduced nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide, also inhibited the step in morphogenesis involving the addition of 
gene 11 product. On the other hand, inhibitors of dfr, such as adenosine
dephosphoribose, stimulated the addition of the gene 11 protein. It has been
concluded that the phage-induced dfr is a baseplate component which is partially 
covered by the gene 11 protein. The properties of phage particles produced after 
infection of the nonpermissive host with the one known T4D mutant containing a
nonsense mutation in its dfr gene suggested that these progeny particles
contained a partial polypeptide, which was large enough to serve as a structural 
element.

Uukuniemi virus contains an RNA polymerase.

Ranki M, Pettersson RF.

An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity has been found associated with Uukuniemi
virions. The enzyme activity is expressed only after disrupting the virions with 
the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 and is absolutely dependent on Mn2+, whereas 
Mg2+ is not required, a finding that distinguishes this polymerase from those of 
other enveloped minus-strand RNA viruses. Within the range pH 7.2 to 8.5 no
distinct optimum was found. The optimum temperature was between 37 and 40 C. The 
reaction was not inhibited by actinomycin D, rifampin, or DNase, whereas RNase
was completely inhibitory. The partially RNase-resistant product consisted of
rather small-sized RNA, which contained sequences complementary to Uukuniemi
virus RNA as shown by hybridization to the template L, M, and S RNA species of
Uukuniemi virus.

tarandus groenlandicus) taken between 1966 and 1968. In five of these 43 animals,
the mandibles had deformities which radiography showed to be the result of dental
abscesses in four cases and probably of a trauma in the other. The absence of
actinomycotic lesions of the jaw bones of these 1,226 animals, and of more than
500 examined previously, indicates that "lumpy jaw" is rare in barren-ground
caribou. The authors suggest the use of radiography to determine the nature of
bone growth on skeletal remains, in the absence of soft tissues for examination
for Actinomyces, either microscopically or by cultural methods.

Experimental diarrhea in cynomolgus monkeys by oral administration with
Clostridium perfringens type A viable cells or enterotoxin.

Uemura T, Sakaguchi G, Ito T, Okazawa K, Sakai S.

Purified C. perfringens type A enterotoxin fed orally in an amount of 5 mg caused
both vomiting and diarrhea in the monkey only when the gastric juice had been
neutralized. Exposure of enterotoxin to pH 4.0 or below rapidly destroyed the
activity. All three monkeys receiving sodium bicarbonate and 2.4 X 10(10) viable 
cells grown in DS medium developed diarrhea, and only one of them vomited once.
The diarrhea lasted for 13, 18 and 19 hr. The symptoms were similar to those
reported in human cases of C. perfringens food poisoning. These results have
verified the general notion that C. perfringens food poisoning should be
categorized as a true "intravital intoxication". The reversed passive
hemagglutination test detected enterotoxin directly in most fecal samples. This
method may be applicable for diagnosis of human cases of C. perfringens food
poisoning. Neither enterotoxin nor anti-enterotoxin was detected in serum samples
taken from any monkey up to 21 days after the challenge. We are tempted to
conclude, therefore, that no significant amount of C. perfringens enterotoxin is 
absorbed from the intestine.

[Effect of peripheral counterpulsation on the body of an animal with intact

[Article in Russian]

Kolesov AP, Skorik VI, Malikova TM, Safonova ES, Shamarina TN.

The effect of lasting peripheral counterpulsation upon the haemodynamics and the 
main biochemical factors of the blood was studied in 14 dogs with intact hearts. 
In cases of significant tachycardia counterpulsation in a 1:2 regimen results in 
only a partial reduction of the resistance to the cardiac output. This does not
always permit to prevent the formation of the phenomenon of an elevated
myocardial contractility. The haemodynamic conditions are most optimal in a 1:1
regimen of counterpulsation. Slowing down of the cardiac rhythm was achieved by
means of hypothermia.

[Regulation of interrelation between pulmonary ventilation and circulation].

[Article in Russian]

Volyntseva VA, Kositskiĭ GI, Kupriianov VS.

In acute experiments on 92 cats anesthetized with Urethane and kept under
controlled respiration the mechanism of tonic activity of the pulmonary vessels
was studied in the presence of a decreased partial pressure of oxygen in the
alveoli. The tonicity of the pulmonary vessels was recorded during autoperfusion 
of the vessels of the posterior lobe of the left lung by means of a perfusion
pump. Simultaneously, the pressure in the common carotid artery was recorded and 
the oxygen saturation of the blood was measured. Pharmacological analysis was
used for the study of the mechanism of the pressor reaction of the pulmonary
vessels under hypoxic hypoxy, and it demonstrated that the pression of the
pulmonary vessels that develops under alveolar hypoxy is less distinct under the 
effect of the ganglioblocking agent Benzo-hexonium, as well as the myotropic
agents Papaverine and Chloracizine. The above reaction was significantly
inhibited by the blocking agents of the D- and M-serotonin-reactive structures --
Dihydroergothamine, Morphine and Novocain, and it was completely lacking against 
the background of the action of Izadrine and Dimedrol -- blocking agents of
serotonin- and histamine-reactive structures. It can be supposed that the D- and 
M-serotonin-reactive, and probably also the histamine-reactive structures
participate in the regulation of the interrelationship of ventilation and
pulmonary circulation.

Multiple cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases in rat kidney.

Gulyassy PF, Farrand JR, Gugler HD.

Using DEAE-cellulose chromatography and Agarose gel filtration we have partially 
purified a low Km cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) phosphodiesterase from the
100,000 X g supernatant of rat kidneys. The characteristics of this enzyme
included a Km of approximately 4 muM a pH optimum of around 8.0 and a requirement
for magnesium. This preparation should be suitable for investigation of possible 
effects of hormones, drugs and cellular constituents on the cyclic AMP pathway
through any direct effects on the low Km enzyme. We have also demonstrated a
nonspecific, high Km cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and possibly a specific 
cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) phosphodiesterase in the soluble fraction
from rat kidneys.

Effect on aging on plasma renin and aldosterone in normal man.

Weidmann P, De Myttenaere-Bursztein S, Maxwell MH, de Lima J.

The influence of aging on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was evaluated 
by comparing young (20 to 30 yr) with elderly (62 to 70 yr) healthy subjects.
Despite comparable body sodium-fluid balance in the two age groups, serum renin
concentration, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations were lower in
the elderly. The age-related decreases in circulating renin and aldosterone
concentrations were slight while subjects were supine and receiving normal sodium
intake; when upright and during sodium depletion, they were more pronounced.
Inverse renin-blood pressure interrelations were noted during two of four study
conditions involving normal sodium intake or mild sodium depletion (r = --0.44
and --0.47, respectively), but not during progressive sodium depletion. Plasma
renin levels were decreased in the elderly regardless of the presence or absence 
of an inverse relationship with blood pressure. Aldosterone and cortisol
responses to corticotropin infusion were unaltered in the elderly. It is
concluded that aging may cause a decrease in circulating renin, with parallel
lowering of plasma aldosterone concentrations.

[Immune mechanisms in uremia].

[Article in German]

Dobbelstein H.

There is both clinical and experimental evidence that cellular and humoral
immunity are suppressed in patients with renal insufficiency: observations in
organ transplantation and in vitro stimulation of lymphocytes from uraemic
patients, investigations of acute and late hypersensitivity reactions, the immune
response after active immunization as well as changes of immunoglobulins and
lymphatic organs in uraemia are discussed in the paper. The underlying mechanisms
are complex and not yet fully understood. Lymphopenia, atrophy of the thymus
gland, toxic serum factors, induction of enhancing mechanisms by certain serum
fractions and metabolic defects of lymphocytes--all were shown to be involved or 
at least considered to be. At present, however, it is impossible to define their 
rank of importance and the exact place they may occupy in the genesis of this
type of "natural immunosuppression".

Improvement of renin determination in human plasma using a commonly available
renin standard in a radioimmunological method.

Hummerich W, Krause DK.

A new method for the measurement of renin in human plasma is described. The
method is based on the introduction of the internationally available renin
standard of the Medical Research Council (MRC) London, as a calibration system.
Thus, some principal disadvantages of methods expressing results in renin
reaction velocity (angiotensin generation rate) only are avoided. Both renins,
unknown and standard, react with a sheep substrate preparation and are handled
identically throughout the whole procedure including the angiotensin I
radioimmunoassay (RIA). The plasma renin concentration (PRC) is given in 10(-6)
MRC-renin units (muM/ml).RESULTS: the renin standard is free of angiotensin,
angiotensinases, and angiotensinogen; it is stable on storage. Identical enzyme
kinetics are shown for both renins. An interference between endogenous and
exogenous substrate could be avoided. The potentially harmful influences of
proteins from the enzyme incubation mixture of the RIA dose response curve are
shown. The use of an angiotensin I calibration system could be omitted. Using a
standard renin dilution from 250-0.9 muU/ml also the full biological range is
covered. When giving an unrestricted diet the preliminary normal values of PRC
are 21.9 +/- 12.6 muU/ml in recumbent and 40.1 +/- 19.8 muU/ml in upright
position (n = 16,x +/- s, age 20-35 years). Earlier findings of age-dependency of
PRC were confirmed.

[Validity of pH measurements by means of micro pH combination electrodes in blood
and other biological fluids (author's transl)].

[Article in German]

Hutten H, Vaupel P.

pH measurements in blood or in media containing either proteins or polypeptides
and performed by means of micro pH combination electrodes type N 58 (Schott &amp;
Gen., Mainz) yield in a systematic error according to the regression line y =
1.135 chi - 0.842, in the range between pH 5.3 and 8.3. This deviation from the
real pH value is independent of the protein concentration and amounts to 0.1-0.2 
pH units in the physiological range. The error does not occur if the pH
measurements are performed in media which are free of proteins and polypeptides, 
respectively. If the electrolyte solution within the reference electrode is
replaced (NaCl solution instead of KCl solution) the error is distinctly reduced.
For this reason, this deviation should be caused by the variation of the
diffusion potential across the platinum junctions.

[Glutathione (author's transl)].

[Article in German]

Benöhr HC, Waller HD.

Glutathione plays an important role in biology and medicine. Most cells of plants
and animals contain high concentrations of reduced glutathione and a much smaller
amount of oxidised glutathione. GSH is important for several metabolic functions 
of live cells, e.g. the protection of oxidative stress by peroxides, mediation of
enzyme reactions, regulation of metabolic events, transport of amino acids across
cell membranes via the gamma-glutamyl cycle, elimination of foreign compounds by 
GSH-conjugation, release of neurotransmitter substances. Irreversible
perturbations of the glutathione metabolism may be the reason for severe clinical
symptoms of hemolytic anemia or, perhaps, of central nervous disease.

The effects of drinking on offspring: an historical survey of the American and
British literature.

Warner RH, Rosett HL.

Current research on the effects on offspring of drinking during pregnancy has
revived interest in an extremely old topic. Observations made during England's
Gin Epidemic (1720-1750) were followed by warnings of 19th-century medical
writers that parental drinking could damage the fetus. Many concurring studies
were reported in the medical literature from 1865 to 1920. Research interest
declined during Prohibition, and authorities later discounted the previous work. 
Recently a relationship between maternal drinking and abnormal morphogenesis has 
been again described.

Hyperexcitability in the neural substrate of emotional behavior in cats after

MacDonnell MF, Brown SH, Davy B.

Substantial and prolonged withdrawal hyperexcitability in the neural substrate
for affective defense was revealed by behavioral and electrophysiological
measures in cats exposed to moderate to heavy doses of alcohol for periods
ranging from 6 to 72 hours. The data are interpreted as indicating a rapid
development of physical dependence on alcohol in this portion of the central
nervous system.

Regional study of acid hydrolases and lysosomal membrane properties in the normal
human brain at various ages.

Brun A, Hultberg B.

Acid hydrolases and lysosomal membrane properties were studied at various ages in
the normal human brain. In CSF and four brain regions, the inferior olive, the
cerebellar cortex, the caudate nucleus and the frontal cortex were thus
beta-galactosidase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-mannosidase, hexosaminidase and acid 
phosphatase biochemically quantitated at ages varying between 2 and 89 years of
age. Also the membrane latency for acid phosphatase was studied in these regions.
No major regional quantitative differences were found with regard to the enzymes 
studied. Their kinetic properties were also defined. There appeared to exist a
regional and intra-areal variation in lysosomal membrane permeability. There was,
however, no age related increase in total enzyme contents. The possibility
significance of these findings are discussed with reference to the aging process.

The late effects of selected immunosuppressants on immunocompetence, disease
incidence, and mean life-span. II. Cell-mediated immune activity.

Peterson WJ, Perkins EH, Goodman SA, Hori Y, Halsall MK, Makinodan T.

The late effects of various immunosuppressive insults on cell-mediated immunity
in mice were studied in an attempt to assess the role of immune surveillance in
the aging process. Results were obtained using susceptibility to allogeneic tumor
cell challenge, graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR), blastogenic response to PHA, a
thymus derived T cell-specific plant mitogen, and cytolytic activity against
allogeneic tumor cells as measures of immunologic activity. In vivo studies late 
in life show that resistance to allogeneic tumor cells is significantly decreased
in thymectomized mice, whereas those treated with cortisone, cyclophosphamide and
sublethal X-ray remain unchanged. Spleen cells from only the thymectomized and
the sublethally irradiated mice show reduced activity in the GVHR. No difference 
is seen in the activity of bone marrow cells. Results consistent with these
findings were obtained in in vitro studies. Thus spleen cells from thymectomized 
or sublethally irradiated mice show decreased activity is response to PHA,
whereas no change is seen in spleen cells from other treated groups. Hence,
surgical and physical insults are more likely to induce long-lasting
immunosuppression in those immunocompetent tissues whose activity normally
diminishes with advancing age. Furthermore, the degree of immunosuppression seen 
in this study is not of the order of magnitude that one could reasonably predict 
a significant decrease in mean life-span.

Lipoxygenase isozymes of peanut.

Sanders TH, Pattee HE, Singleton JA.

Lipoxygenase was isolated and partially purified from peanut seed by ammonium
sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and ion exchange column chromatography.
Three isozymes of lipoxygenase were identified. Two had pH optima of 6.2, and the
other an optimum of 8.3. Molecular weight of each isozyme was 7.3 x 10(4), as
determined by gel filtration. The alkaline optimum isozyme was not inhibited by
NaCN and was inhibited by CaCl2 except at very low concentrations. The acid
optimum isozymes were inhibited by NaCN and were stimulated by CaCl2
concentrations up to ca. 0.7 mM.

[Computer experience and further developments in the respiratory function
laboratory (author's transl)].

[Article in German]

Schindl R, Mayer K, Aigner K.

Reported is on satisfactory results obtained with a small-size computer
consisting of punching and scanning device, as well as plain writing machine in
the respiratory function laboratory. Developed in on- as well as off-line
processing by an own technical staff, a diagnostic and teaching program was
established for all respiratory function routine methods with the advantages of a
large number of cases examined, elimination of sources of error, considerable
supply of data and information, automatic documentation and filing, plain
writing, interpretation and evaluation of findings. In continuation of such works
also the blood gas analysis has been included. These values as the total of
disturbances of the pathophysiological acid-base status are considered and
interpreted. Clinical correction is forced in this man-machine dialogue by
automatic stops of the whole machinery before going on. Subsequently and in
addition are computer alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient, venous shunt
and oxygen saturation and expressed utilizing the capacity of the small-size
computer. Further developments in the respiratory function diagnostic- and
teaching program for small-size computers--not too expensive in the building
block principle - are intended.

L-tyrosine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase induction by hydrocortisone in the
thymus of the white rat.

Abraham AD.

Hydrocortisone hemisuccinate within 4 hours after in vivo administration produced
an increase in precursor incoporation into rat thymus RNA and proteins in the
whole animal. From these results, together with information obtained from
measurements of the tyrosine aminotransferase activity and the action of
mitomycin C administered one hour before the injection of hydrocortisone, it can 
be concluded that the increase in tissue level of the enzyme, consequent to
hydrocortisone treatment, results from an increased rate of biosynthesis of the
enzyme, which participates in the catabolic processes of proteins in
glucocorticoid sensitive thymus cells.

Identification of the 30 S protein adjacent to peptidyl transferase catalytic
center of Escherichia coli ribosomes.

Hatayama T, Yukioka M, Morisawa S.

Iodoacetylphenylalanyl-tRNAPhe was used as an affinity label to localize the
ribosomal components involved in the peptidyl transferase catalytic center of
Escherichia coli ribosomes. When labeling was carried out at pH 5.0, the affinity
label could specifically label the ribosomal components which comprise the
catalytic center. Analysis of ribosomal proteins which had reacted with the
affinity label revealed that a 30 S subunit protein, S 20, was located at or near
to the ribosomal binding site of the 3'-terminus of aminoacyl- or peptidyl-tRNA.

The value of a histamine H2-receptor antagonist in the management of patients
with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

Richardson CT, Walsh JH.

Inhibition of acid secretion by an H2-receptor antagonist (metiamide) was
assessed in three patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Metiamide (200 or
300 mg) inhibited acid secretion transiently (2 1/2 hours) by 85 to 100 per cent 
in all patients. Although anticholinergic drugs alone inhibited acid secretion by
only 0 to 35 per cent in these patients, the combination of metiamide and
anticholinergic markedly prolonged the inhibitory effect of metiamide. Total
gastrectomy was refused by one patient, and was impossible in another; both were 
treated with metiamide and anticholinergic for five and 10 months. A third
patient was treated with metiamide and anticholinergic for three weeks in
preparation for total gastrectomy. Ulcer pain and diarrhea disappeared, and each 
gained weight. H2-receptor antagonists may be useful in the treatment of some
patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

Histamine receptors in the vasculature of the rabbit ear.

Ercan ZS, Türker RK.

Histamine has a dual action on the isolated perfused ear preparation of the
rabbit. The amine induced a dose-dependent rise in perfusion pressure when the
preparation was perfused with Krebs' solution. This pressor response was reversed
to a depressor effect when meypramine was added to the perfusion fluid. This
depressor effect of the amine was also dose-related. Metiamide competitively
inhibited the depressor effect of histamine. Prior treatment of the ear vessels
with metiamide alone caused an increase in histamine-induced perfusion pressure. 
From these results it was concluded that the predominant pressor effect of
histamine on the vascular bed of the rabbit ear is mediated through the
H1-receptors and the depressor effect of the amine through histamine
H2-receptors.

Relative pre- and postsynaptic potencies of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists in the
rabbit pulmonary artery.

Starke K, Endo T, Taube HD.

The rabbit pulmonary artery contains postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors which
meidate smooth muscle contraction; its noradrenergic nerves contain presynaptic
alpha-adrenoceptors which mediate inhibition of the release of the transmitter
evoked by nerve impulses. Dose-response curves for the pre- and postsynaptic
effects of eight alpha-receptor agonists were determined on superfused strips of 
the artery in the presence of cocaine, corticosterone and propranolo. 1.
According to the concentrations which caused 20% of the maximal contraction (EC20
post), the postsynaptic rank order of potency was: adrenaline greater than
noradrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than naphazoline greater than
phenylephrine greater than tramazoline greater than alpha-methylnoradrenaline
greater than methoxamine. The pA2 values of phentolamine againstoxymethazoline,
phenylephrine, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and methoxamine were 7.43, 7.48, 7.59
and 7.69, respectively. 2. For the investigation of presynaptic effects, the
arteries were preincubated with 3H-noradrenaline. All agonists inhibited the
overflow of tritium evoked by transmural sympathetic nerve stimulation. According
to the concentrations which reduced the stimulation-induced overflow by 20% (EC20
pre), the rank order of potency was: adrenaline greater than oxymetazoline
greater than tramazoline greater than alpha-methylnoradrenaline greater than
noradrenaline greater than naphazoline greater than phenylephrine greater than
methoxamine. 10(-5) M phentolamine shifted the presynaptic dose-response curves
for moradrenaline and oxymethazoline to the right. 3. The ratio EC20 pre/EC20
post was calculated for each agonist as an index of its relative post- and
presynaptic potency. According to the ratios, the agonists were arbitrarily
classified into three groups. Group 1 (ratio about 30: preferentially
postsynaptic agonists) comprised methoxamine and phenylephrine; group 2 (ratio
near 1; similar pre- and postsynaptic potencies) comprised noradrenaline,
adrenaline and naphazoline; group 3 (ratio below 0.2; preferentially presynaptic 
agonists) comprised oxymetazoline, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and tramazoline (as 
well as clonidine). 4. Preferentially presynaptic and preferentially postsynaptic
agonists had opposite effects on the basoconstrictor response to nerve
stimulation. Methoxamine and phenylephrine either did not change or enhanced, but
never reduced, the response. In contrast, oxymetazoline,
alpha-methylnoradrenaline and tramazoline at low concentrations selectively
inhibited the response to stimulation at low frequency (0.25-2Hz). 5. It is
concluded that alpha-adrenoceptor agonists vary widely in their relative pre- and
postsynaptic potencies, possibly because of structural differences between pre-
and postsynaptic alpha-receptors. Pre- and postsynaptic components contribute to 
their overll postsynaptic effec in actively transmitting synapses. The
preferential activation of presynaptic alpha-receptors results in
alpha-adrenergic inhibition of synaptic transmission.

Investigation into some imidazoline compounds, with respect to peripheral
alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation and depression of cardiovascular centers.

Kobinger W, Pichler L.

Peripheral alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation was tested by means of hypertensive
effects of the drugs following i.v. injection in spinal rats. Naphazoline (NP),
oxymetazoline (OM), St 91-2-(2,6-diethylphenylimino)-2-imidazolidine--and St
1697--2-(2-ethyl, 6-methylphenylimino)-2-imidazolidine--were 3 to 5 times more
potent in tthis respect thatn clonidine (CLON) whereas St
363--2-(2,4-dichlorophenylimino)-2-imidazolidine--and xylazine (XY) exerted only 
approx. 1/20 the effect of that of clonidine. Sympathoinhibitory activity after
i.v. injection was tested by the bradycardiac effect in vagotomized rats; St
1697, St 363 and XY were active, approx. 1/10-1/30 of CLON, whereas NP, OM and St
91 were inactive. However, following intracisternal (i.ci.) injection of
cardiovascular depression, typical for clonidine: (1) in dogs with blocked
beta-adrenoceptors, the drugs facilitated the vagally meditated cardiodepressor
reflex in response to baroreceptor stimulation by i.v. injection of angiotensin; 
(2) in dogs treated with atropine and in (3) vagotomized cats (only NP, OM and St
363) a long lasting decrease in heart rate was observed. Some of the experiments 
were complicated by increases in blood pressure, due to the "leakage" of small
amounts of the highly vasopressor active drugs, from the cisternal spaces into
the peripheral circulation. The majority of results indicated, that the central
cardiovascular depressor effects of the tested drugs depend on their
alpha-adrenoreceptor stimulating potency and on their ability to penetrate from
cerebrospinal fluid or from the blood to cardiovascular centers. Relationships
between the ability for penetration and the lipoid affinity are discussed.

The regulation of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase. Effects of gamma hydroxybutric
acid and healperidol.

Zivkovic B, Guidotti A, Costa E.

Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHBA) in doses that increased the striatal dopamine
(DA) content of rat brain failed to increase the affinity of striatal tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH) for its pterdine cofactor or to change the sensitivity of the
enzyme to the inhibition by DA. Haloperidol (1 mg/kg) decreased the apparent Km
of striatal TH for the pteridine cofactor. However, when GHBA was injected before
haloperidol it prevented the decrease in the apparent Kn of TH, in a dose related
manner. In vitro GHBA (10(-4) M) neither changed the stimulation of the striatal 
adenylyl cyclase by DA nor its inhibition by haloperidol. These results suggest
that in striatal dopaminergic terminals the Kn of TH for the pteridine cofactor
is regulated by an molecuular mechanism which requires that the impulse flow in
the DA neurons is unimpaired.

Host-tumor relationship XXXIII. Inhibitor of hyaluronidase in blood serum of
cancer patients.

Kolárová M.

Inhibiting activity of blood serum was determined from the decrease of
N-acetyl-hexosamine end groups of hyaluronic acid products released by testicular
hyaluronidase. Maximum inhibition was observed within the region of pH from 6.5
to 6.8. Correlation between the serum concentration and its inhibiting effect on 
hyaluronidase was found within the range of the final dilution of serum (in the
reaction mixture) from 9 to 45 X. Blood sera of cancer patients showed
statistically significant increase of hyaluronidase inhibitor as compared with
that of health people.

Influence of peritoneal dialysis on factors affecting oxygen transport.

Hirszel P, Maher JF, Tempel GE, Mengel CE.

To determine the effect of changing concentrations of uremic metabolites on
factors affecting oxygen transport, without the effects of extracorporeal blood
pumping, we studied five patients before, during and after peritoneal dialysis.
Significant decreases in serum urea, creatinine and phosphate and increase in
serum bicarbonate were not associated with changes in P50, a reflection of
hemoglobin-oxygen affinity. High erythrocyte 2,3-DPG concentrations decreased
only slightly. Arterial pO2 increased slightly as negative fluid balance was
achieved. The slight changes in oxygen transport parameters with dialysis suggest
an interplay of compensatory factors and do not warrant modifying dialysis to
limit the correction on acidosis or hyperphosphatemia. Effects on hemoglobin and 
pO2 resulting from fluid loss can be the dominant influence of peritoneal
dialysis on tissue oxygenation.

Some effects of ammonium salts on renal histology and function in the dog.

Orvell BD, Wesson LG.

NH4Cl was infused into the left renal artery of anesthetized dogs at 50-125
mum/kg/min for up to 110 min. Renal blood flow declined early then increased to
supra-control levels during infusion. Kidneys perfused at 125 mum/kg/min for 90
min showed patchy to confluent mixtures of cortical necrosis and tubular
necrosis. Experimental kidneys invariably showed lower urine osmolality than
contralateral controls 48 h after perfusion. Kidneys with necrosis showed
depressed creatinine clearance as well. Renal artery infusion of NH4 acetate or
intravenous infusion of NaHCO3 during arterial infusion of NH4Cl prevented
significant acidosis and caused minimal histological changes, but depression of
urine osmolality was not prevented. It is concluded that renal ammonium
concentrations up to 40 mum/liter for 90 min does not cause tubular necrosis but 
does impair urine concentration. Severe tissue damage followed renal exposure to 
high ammonium concentrations in the presence of metabolic or renal acidosis.

Papillary necrosis associated with calyceal arteritis.

Heaton JM, Bourke E.

The renal papilla has a double blood supply - from both the vasa recta and the
calyceal arteries. The importance of the latter supply is not established. A case
of polyarteritis associated with papillary necrosis is reported, in which the
calyceal vessels, supplying the area, show acute necrotizing arteritis and
occlusion. The pathophysiological and clinical implications are discussed.

Fasting uric acid and phosphate in urine and plasma of renal calcium-stone
formers.

Schwille P, Samberger N, Wach B.

Clearance experiments in calcium-stone patients (n = 60) and controls (n = 60)
demonstrated significantly higher urinary uric acid (UA) in younger (less 40
years) stone patients than controls (median: 480 vs. 351 mug/min) but not in
older (greater than 40 years) patients. Serum UA and urinary oxypurines were
comparable in health and stone disease. Conversely urinary phosphate was
significantly lower in younger patients than matched controls (males: 224 vs. 304
mug) and presumably is responsible for the more alkaline pH. It is suggested that
calcium-stone formation in humans is represented by two different populations.

Effects of varying dialysate calcium concentrations on the plasma calcium
fractions in patients on dialysis.

Raman A, Chong YK, Sreenevasan GA.

The plasma-ionized calcium levels decreased during haemodialysis when a dialysate
calcium concentration of 5 mg/100 ml was used. When dialysis was performed with a
bath calcium concentration of 7.5 mg/100 ml, there was a significant increase in 
the plasm-ionized calcium levels in the post-dialysis period. These results are
discussed in relation of the optimal dialysate calcium concentrations and
development of dialytic bone disease.

[Borderline between antiepileptic and psychopharmacological drugs (author's
transl)].

[Article in German]

Groh C, Rosenmayr FW.

From the chemical and pharmalogical point of view it is impossible to separate
strictly between antiepileptic and psychopharmalogical drugs. Inspite of that and
several clinical overlappings it is possible and helpful finding differences
between the two groups of drugs. Basing on the indication we try to demonstrate
the use of these drug-groups. 1. Antiepileptic drugs in behaviour disorders. A.
In spite of various publications we recommend carefullness and restriction. B.
Only in case of behaviour disorders due to epileptic origin antiepileptic therapy
is indicated. 2. Psychopharmalogical drugs in epilepsies A. The frequency of
seizures may be reduced B. Psychical disorders connected with seizures may be
influnced.

Identification, purification and properties of clone-specific glycoprotein
antigens constituting the surface coat of Trypanosoma brucei.

Cross GA.

Soluble glycoproteins have been purified from a series of clones of Trypanosoma
brucei 427. Each clone yielded a characteristic predominant glycoprotein which
induced clone-specific immunity to trypanosome infection in mice. These
glycoproteins were shown by specific labelling and enzyme digestion of cells to
be the major components of the trypanosome surface coat. Each glycoprotein
consisted of a single polypeptide chain having an apparent molecular weight of 65
000 (as measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and containing around
600 amino acid and 20 monosaccharide residues. Preliminary structural studies
indicated large changes in amino acid sequence dispersed over a considerable
length of the polypeptide chain. Proteolytic activity was demonstrated in
semi-purified trypanosome extracts, providing one reason for the heterogeneity
sometimes observed in surface glycoprotein antigen preparations.

The determination of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase by reaction rate assay at 37
degrees C.

Farrance I, Krauja VW, Dennis PM.

The determination of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase by a reaction rate assay using
optimal reaction conditions at 37 degrees is described. Specific conditions and
instrument settings are described for the LKB Reaction Rate Analyser but the
actual assay conditions are applicable to any similar reaction rate system. The
precision of the method has been evaluated and a reference range for normal male 
(less than 45 U/l) and female (less than 30 U/l) subjects determined.

The influence of cortisol on the enzymes of fatty acid synthesis in developing
mammalian lung and brain.

Gross I, Rooney SA, Warshaw JB.

Administration of cortisol to fetal rabbits resulted in a 42% inhibition of
pulmonary de novo fatty acid synthesis from acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) (P = less
than 0.025). This was associated with inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC.
6.4.1.2.) activity (P = less than 0.01) and a tendency towards decreased activity
of fatty acid synthetase. There was no effect on pulmonary microsomal fatty acid 
elongation activity. Light and electron microscopic examination of the apex of
the right lung of control and cortisol-treated animals revealed changes
consistent with accelerated lung maturation in the treated animals. The in vitro 
activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase were similar in
rabbit lung and thus acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity does not appear to be rate
limiting for de novo fatty acid synthesis in lung. No significant change in the
activity of enzymes associated with de novo fatty acid synthesis of microsomal
fatty acid elongation was found in fetal brain after cortisol exposure. However, 
in a parallel study on fatty acid synthesis in fetal liver, cortisol
administration resulted in a 30% increase in fatty acid synthetase activity (P
less than 0.025). The finding of cortisol-induced inhibition of de novo fatty
acid synthesis in fetal rabbit lung may be related to the known inhibitory effect
of cortisol on lung growth in the fetus.

The relation between myosin adenosinetriphosphatase activity and inactivation of 
myosin under alkaline conditions of heart muscles in mammals of different size.

Syrový I.

ATPase activity of myosin in the heart muscle of the mouse, rat, guinea-pig,
rabbit and pig was studied at neutral pH and under mild alkaline conditions. At
neutral pH the ATPase activity of myosin is inversely related to body size of the
animal species. The decrease of ATPase activity of myosin after alkaline
preincubation depends on the degree of ATPase activity of intact myosin, i.e.
myosin from the heart of the mouse exhibits high ATPase activity ae same
relationship was found, when comparing myosin of new-born and adult heart muscle.
It is concluded that the rate of alkaline inactivation of heart myosin is
directly related to the degree of ATPase activity of intact myosin in all
animals.

Carbon dioxide response curves during hypothermia.

Ruiz AV.

The responsiveness of the medullary chemoreceptors, measured by the ventilatory
response to hypercapnia given in an hyperoxic gas mixture in intact anesthetized 
dogs has been evaluated during normothermia and at two levels of hypothermia. The
response was studied in: 1) 20 dogs during normothermia, 2) 10 of these dogs at a
blood temperature of 32-33 degrees C, and 3) in the other 10 dogs during deeper
hypothermia (28-29 degrees C). The ventilatory response to CO2 decreased while
blood temperature was lowered until the response became absent during deep
hypothermia. For normothermia and both levels of hypothermia a similar oxygen
drive of ventilation was found which was equivalent to approximately one fourth
of the spontaneous ventilation. It is suggested, that in the deeply hypothermic
animal the normal respiratory drive is apparently of peripheral (arterial)
chemoreceptor origin and when this drive is nullified or significantly decreased,
gentle shivering could be responsible for stimulating the respiratory center.

[Zollinger-Ellison syndrome treated medically by an inhibitor of H2 histamine
receptors].

[Article in French]

Bonfils S, Bernier JJ, Mignon M, Hautefeuille P, Corbic M, Marteau J.

Metiamide an histamine H2-receptors antagonist has been used to treat a case of
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome characterized by a long standing diarrhea, an
important gastric hypersecretion and a moderatly elevated plasma gastrin but
without digestive ulceration. At the dose of 600 mg per day, Metiamide induced a 
complete suppression of acid secretion, an effect which lasted for 15 days after 
stopping the drug. Accordingly and since the only finding at time of laparotomy
was a small lymph node enlarged with endocrine metastatic tissue, the stomach was
left intact and Metiamide pursued. During the first 4 months of chronic
administration of Metiamide, acid secretion was maintained at levels below 25
p.cent of initial values. Ulteriorly however, although dosages of Metiamide were 
increased, acid hypersecretion resumed and a duodenal ulcer developed. Total
gastrectomy was then performed 11 months after the beginning of Metiamide. In
spite of the failure of Metiamide treatment, the long term follow up of this case
of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, allowed us to get theoretical and practical
informations.

[Exercise test in the asthmatic patient. Study of 75 patients].

[Article in French]

Orehek J, Saraga E, Gayrard P, Grimaud C, Charpin J.

Comment in
    Injury. 2006 Jan;37(1):85-6; author reply 86-7.

Frequency of exercise-induced asthma has been studied in 75 unselected asthmatic 
patients (adults and children) by measuring the forced expiratory volume at one
second (FEV1) and the vital capacity (VC) before and after a treadmill exercise, 
continued until heart rate was at least equal to 80 p.cent-85 p.cent of maximum
heart rate. In 19 subjects (25 p.cent), a more than 20 p.cent decrease from
control value of FEV1 was recorded ten minutes after exercise ended.
Exercise-induced bronchial obstruction was relieved by a beta adrenergic
bronchodilator aerosol inhalation. In the group of 19 subjects having
exercise-induced asthma, a significant positive correlation was found between
pre-exercise FEV1 values and post-exercise FEV1 decreases. In the whole group of 
75 subjects exercise-induced asthma was related to the severity of asthma and not
to other clinical or physical characteristics of the subjects. From the data of
other authors it appears that frequency of exercise-induced asthma is variable.
The reasons of those differences are discussed.

Intranasal betamethasone valerate in seasonal rhinitis.

Coffman DA, Jenkins M.

A double-blind study comparing betamethasone valerate and placebo aerosols was
carried out in 40 patients with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis and
positive skin tests to grass pollens. Analysis of the symptoms recorded on a
daily record card for a period of one month indicated that the mean monthly
symptom-score was lower for all symptoms in the group on active therapy and that 
this reached statistical significance for the symptom of sneezing. Significantly 
more antihistamine tablets were used by the placebo group as compared with the
active group (p less than 0-05). The patients' assessment of their treatment was 
in favour of betamethasone valerate (p less than 0-05). No clinically significant
side-effects were associated with the treatment, which was well tolerated.

Urinary acidification in renal allografts.

Graziani G, de Vecchi A, Ponticelli C.

Urinary acid excretion was measured in 35 human renal allograft recipients during
the first few days after the onset of diuresis and two months after
transplantation. In 16 out of 17 rejection episodes an early significant decrease
of renal total net H+ excretion was observed. This urinary acidification
impairment preceded the serum creatinine increase. Only few patients showed
variations in blood pH and C1-. The acidification defect may be due to the
ischaemic changes of rejection. Early impairment of urinary acidification
supports a clinical diagnosis of rejection.

A simple test for early detection of severe renal homograft rejection.

Oppolzer R, Leithner C, Wolf A, Pinggera W, Stummvoll H.

Adding urine to a standard buffered fibrinogen solution and then coagulating it
with thrombin gives reproducible coagulation times with normal urines.
Coagulation of fibrinogen by thrombin is prolonged in acid solutions with a pH
below six. Urines of high acidity lower the buffer pH of the fibrinogen solution 
below a value of six thus rendering the system uncoagulable or significantly
prolonging the coagulation time. With this test system we found that out of 16
severe homograft rejections 15 were accompanied by a high acid excretion in
six-hour urine specimens. Ten of these acid episodes became apparent 12 to 48 hr 
before clinical symptoms and before elevation of the serum creatinine could be
detected.

Catalysis by acetylcholinesterase: evidence that the rate-limiting step for
acylation with certain substrates precedes general acid-base catalysis.

Rosenberry TL.

Inferences about the catalytic mechanism of acetylcholinesterase (acetylcholine
hydrolase, EC 3.1.1.7) are frequently made on the basis of a presumed analogy
with chymotrypsin, EC 3.4.21.1. Although both enzymes are serine hydrolases,
several differences in the steady-state kinetic properties of the two have been
observed. In this report particular attention is focused on the second-order
reaction constant, kcat/Kapp. While the reported pH dependence and deuterium
oxide isotope effect associated with this parameter for chymotrypsin are
generally consistent with simple models involving rate-limiting general acid-base
catalysis, this study finds a more complicated situation with
acetylcholinesterase. The apparent pKa of kcat/Kapp for acetylcholinesterase
varies between 5.5 and 6.3 for neutral substrates and involves nonlinear
inhibition by [H+]. Deuterium oxide isotope effects for kcat/Kapp range from 1.1 
for acetylcholine to 1.9 for p-nitrophenyl acetate. The bimolecular reaction rate
appears rate-limiting for acetylcholine at low concentrations, while a
rate-limiting induced-fit step is proposed to account for apparent pKa values and
low deuterium oxide isotope effects associated with low concentrations of phenyl 
acetate and isoamyl acetate.

Light-dependent absorption and selective scattering changes at 518 nm in
chloroplast thylakoid membranes.

Thorne SW, Horvath G, Kahn A, Boardman NK.

The light-induced absorbance change at 518 nm of isolated chloroplasts consists
of a rapid phase, and a slow phase which is complete in about 20 sec. The slow
component of the 518 nm absorbance change correlates with the light-induced
change in 90 degrees light scattering at 518 nm. Both show a similar time course,
similar pH dependence with a maximum at pH 6.0, and similar sensitivity to
inhibitors and to treatment of the chloroplasts with a low concentration of
glutaraldehyde. Their light minus dark difference spectra are similar with maxima
at about 520 nm. It is concluded that they are manifestations of the same
phenomenon, and the slow absorbance increase at 518 nm is due to enhanced
scattering. It is proposed that the light-induced changes in scattering at 518 nm
reflect alterations in selective dispersion, due to proton uptake and
conformational changes in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane.

phiX174 DNA-dependent DNA synthesis in vitro: requirement for P1 ban protein in
dnaB mutant extracts of Escherichia coli.

Schuster H, Mikolajczyk M, Rohrschneider J, Geschke B.

Ammonium sulfate fractionation of crude extracts of E. coli yields a soluble
enzyme fraction (about 25-fold purification) that catalyzes the conversion of
phiX174 single-stranded DNA to duplex DNA. The reaction is rifampicin-resistant, 
requires single-stranded DNA, Mg++, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and ATP, and
is stimulated by KCl. Such soluble enzyme fractions were prepared from E. coli
strains carrying the prophage mutant P1bac, in which the viral dnaB analog (ban) 
protein is expressed constitutively, or P1bacban, in which the expression of ban 
protein is prevented. DNA-synthesizing activity of ban protein containing
fractions from wild-type or dnaB(P1bac) lysogens was more temperature-resistant
than that from E. coli containing only wild-type dnaB protein, whereas that from 
dnaB(P1bacban) lysogens of dnaB cells was extremely thermolabile. It is suggested
that the temperature-resistant DNA synthesis with fractions from P1bac lysogens
is mediated by the P1 ban protein.

Intramolecular arsanilazotyrosine-248-Zn complex of carboxypeptidase A: a monitor
of catalytic events.

Harrison LW, Auld DS, Vallee BL.

The intensely chromophoric intramolecular coordination complex formed between
arsanilazotyrosine-248 and the active site zinc atom of azocarboxypeptidase A
(Johansen, J. T. &amp; Vallee, B. L. (1971) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 68, 2532-2535) 
is a spectrokinetic probe of catalytic events. The interconversion of the
azoTyr-248-Zn complex and its constituents is measured by stopped-flow pH and
temperature-jump methods. The rate of interconversion, 64,000 sec-1, is orders of
magnitude faster than that of the catalytic step itself (about 0.01-100 sec-1).
Rapidly turned over peptide and ester substrates disrupt the azoTyr-248-Zn
complex before hydrolysis occurs. As a consequence, formation of azoTyr-248,
substrate binding, and catalysis can all be monitored while catalysis is actually
in progress. The results of these dynamic studies specify a course of catalytic
events, different from those postulated based on x-ray structure analysis. If
azoTyr-248 is displaced, the direction is opposite to the inward movement
postulated on the basis of x-ray studies and is not unique to induction by
substrates, since rapid changes in pH also result in analogous spectral changes. 
AzoTyr-248 carboxypeptidase has all the features which are essential for
mechanistic studies: (1) It is enzymatically active; (2) the spectra of the metal
complex differ characteristically from those of its constituents; (3) it responds
dynamically to environmental factors; and (4) the response time of the probe
itself is much more rapid than is required for the measurement of the catalytic
step. These combined kinetic and spectral properties of the metal complex render 
it a powerful spectrokinetic probe to visualize and discern microscopic details
of the catalytic process.

Ubiquinone-mediated coupling of NADH dehydrogenase to active transport in
membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli.

Stroobant P, Kaback HR.

Addition of ubiquinone-1 to E. coli ML 308-225 membrane vesicles dramatically
increases coupling between NADH oxidation and active transport such that initial 
rates and steady-state levels of lactose and amino-acid accumulation are
comparable to those observed during D-lactate oxidation. Similar but less
dramatic effects are observed with the quinone and succinate or L-lactate. In the
presence of NADH and ubiquinone-1, the vesicles also generate a membrane
potential (interior negative) that is similar in magnitude to that observed in
the presence of D-lactate. Stimulation of NADH-dependent transport by
ubiquinone-1 cannot be accounted for by increased rates of oxidation of NADH, and
the effect of the quinone on NADH-dependent lactose transport is not observed in 
vesicles depleted of NADH dehydrogenase activity. Thus, it is apparent that
ubiquinone-1 shunts electrons from NADH dehydrogenase
[NADH:(acceptor)oxidoreductase; EC 1.6.99.3] to the portion of the respiratory
chain containing the energy-coupling site. The findings demonstrate unequivocally
that inefficient coupling of NADH oxidation to active transport cannot be due to 
the presence of inverted vesicles. In addition, they provide further support for 
specific localization of the energy-coupling site.

Protection of lethally irradiated mice with allogeneic fetal liver cells:
influence of irradiation dose on immunologic reconstitution.

Tulunay O, Good RA, Yunis EJ.

After lethal irradiation long-lived, immunologically vigorous C3Hf mice were
produced by treatment with syngeneic fetal liver cells or syngeneic newborn or
adult spleen cells. Treatment of lethally irradiated mice with syngeneic or
allogeneic newborn thymus cells or allogeneic newborn or adult spleen cells
regularly led to fatal secondary disease or graft-versus-host reactions.
Treatment of the lethally irradiated mice with fetal liver cells regularly
yielded long-lived, immunologically vigorous chimeras. The introduction of the
fetal liver cells into the irradiated mice appeared to be followed by development
of immunological tolerance of the donor cells. The findings suggest that T-cells 
at an early stage of differentiation are more susceptible to tolerance induction 
than are T-lymphocytes at later stages of differentiation. These investigations
turned up a perplexing paradox which suggests that high doses of irradiation may 
injure the thymic stroma, rendering it less capable of supporting certain T-cell 
populations in the peripheral lymphoid tissue. Alternatively, the higher and not 
the lower dose of irradiation may have eliminated a host cell not readily derived
from fetal liver precursors which represents an important helper cell in certain 
cell-mediated immune functions, e.g., graft-versus-host reactions, but which is
not important in others, e.g., allograft rejections. The higher dose of lethal
irradiation did not permit development or maintenance of a population of spleen
cells that could initiate graft-versus-host reactions but did permit the
development of a population of donor cells capable of achieving vigorous
allograft rejection. These observations contribute to understanding of some of
the persisting immunodeficiencies that are observed in man after fatal
irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. These results should suggest better 
approaches to more effective cellular engineering for correction of
immunodeficiency diseases and for treatment of immunodeficiency diseases and of
leukemias and malignancies of man.

Mechanism of action of penicillin: triggering of the pneumococcal autolytic
enzyme by inhibitors of cell wall synthesis.

Tomasz A, Waks S.

During penicillin treatment of an autolysin defective mutant pneumococcus we have
observed three novel phenomena: (i) Growth of the mutant cultures is inhibited by
the same concentrations of penicillin that induce lysis in the wild type. (ii)
Mutant bacteria treated with the minimum growth inhibitory concentration of
penicillin will lyse upon the addition of wild-type autolysin to the growth
medium. Chloramphenicol and other inhibitors of protein synthesis protect the
cells against lysis by exogenous enzyme. Sensitivity of the cells to exogenous
autolysin requires treatment with penicillin or other inhibitors of cell wall
synthesis (e.g., D-cycloserine or fosfonomycin) since exogenous autolysin alone
has no effect on bacterial growth. (iii) Treatment with penicillin (or other
inhibitors of cell wall synthesis) causes the escape into the medium of a
choline-containing macromolecule that has properties suggesting that it contains 
pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid (Forssman antigen). Each one of these three
phenomena (growth inhibition, sensitization to exogenous autolysin, and leakage
of lipoteichoic acid) shows the same dose response as that of the
penicillin-induced lysis of wild-type pneumococci. On the basis of these findings
we propose a new hypothesis for the mechanism of penicillin-induced lysis of
bacteria. It is suggested that inhibition of cell wall synthesis by any means
triggers bacterial autolytic enzymes by destabilizing the endogenous complex of
an autolysin inhibitor (lipoteichoic acid) and autolytic enzyme. Escape of
lipoteichoic acid-like material to the growth medium is a consequence of this
labilization. Chloramphenicol protects bacteria against penicillin-induced lysis 
by interfering with the activity of the autolytic enzyme, rather than by
depleting the concentration of the enzyme at the cell surface.

Identification of NADPH-thioredoxin reductase system in Euglena gracillis.

Munavalli S, Parker DV, Hamilton FD.

Euglena gracilis contains a protein system which can utilize the reducing power
of NADPH in the ribonucleotide reductase-catalyzed reduction of CTP. The proteins
required for this reaction are a flavoprotien with a molecular weight of
approximately 185,000 which is functionally similar to thioredoxin reductase
(NADPH), EC 1.6.4.5, and another protein (Protein I) whose function in the
reaction is unknown. This new protein does not appear to contain a prosthetic
group and has a molecular weight of approximately 240,000. In addition, the
ribonucleotide reductase active in the Euglena NADPH-thioredoxin reductase system
is more complex than the protein reported in a previous publication [(1974) j.
Biol. Chem. 249, 4428-4434]. The enzyme preparation described in this report
contains four different types of polypeptide chains which may complex to form the
active enzyme.

Purification of folate binding factor in normal umbilical cord serum.

Kamen BA, Caston JD.

Human umbilical cord serum was found to contain both free folate and folate
complexed to a high-molecular weight factor. The complexed folate was bound to a 
very high affinity binder and was present in concentrations equivalent to as much
as 60 ng of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid per ml of serum. Acidification of the
serum caused disassociation of the folate-binder complex. Released folates were
separated from binder by Sephadex gel filtration, zonal centrifugation through
sucrose gradients, or adsorption onto activated charcoal. The separated binding
factor, either saturated or unsaturated with folate, had a molecular weight of
about 40,000 on Sephadex G-200 chromatography. Binding of [3H]pteroylglutamic
acid was rapid and, as in the original endogenous folate-binder complex, was
essentially irreversible at neutral pH. The affinity and specificity of the
binder were examined by competition experiments using [3H]pteroylglutamic acid
and nonradioactive folate derivatives. Oxidized folates were bound in preference 
to reduced derivatives, but only three to four times more unlabeled
5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid than pteroylglutamic acid was required to produce an
equal level of competition. The strong affinity for 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid,
the main serum folate, suggests that the binder could be part of the mechanism by
which the fetus concentrates maternally supplied folate for its growth and
development.

Intramolecular arsanilazotyrosine-248-Zn complex of carboxypeptidase A: a monitor
of multiple conformational states in solution.

Harrison LW, Auld DS, Vallee BL.

The red azoTyr-248-Zn complex of arnilazocarboxypeptidase, previously used to
demonstrate differences in conformation of the enzyme in crystals and in
solution, has now provided means to detect multiple conformations of the enzyme
in solution by stopped-flow pH and temperature jump experiments. These studies
identify two distinct processes. Er + H+ in equilibrium Ey (I), is the extremely 
rapid, Kfast about 10(5) sec-1, pH dependent dissociation of the metal complex.
Ey in equilibrium Ey' (II), is much slower, Kslow about 5 sec-1, pH independent
interconversion of two distinct populations of protein molecules, Ey and Ey', in 
which the yellow azo-Tyr-248 is different conformations. These two conformations 
can be differentiated readily by stopped-flow pH-jump experiments, since I is
three to four orders of magnitude faster than II. Mathematical expressions
derived from this mechanism accurately predict all observations over the pH range
from 6.0 to 8.5. In a previous stopped-flow pH-jump experiment, Lipcomb and
coworkers [Quiocho, F. A., McMurray, C. H. &amp; Lipcomb, W. H. (1972), Proc. Nat.
Acad. Sci. USA 69, 2850-2854] recognized only a single process with a rate
constant of about 6 sec-1, but not the major, very rapid rate observed here. The 
failure to detect this fast process led to the postulation of a number of
explanations intended to account for the detection of only a single, slow rate.
The present observations show that the premise for those conjectures is not
valid. The azoprobe reveals the existence of rapidly interconvertible
substructures of carboxypeptidase A, and the results support the view that in
solution, enzymes can adopt multiple, readily interconvertible and related
conformations which could then either facilitate or impede catalysis. In
crystals, rearrangement of molecular structure could be severely impaired or
restricted, and crystallization might single out either active or inactive
conformations. In the latter case, such crystals would have greatly reduced
activities and markedly altered catalytic behavior, as is observed for
carboxypeptidase A. In combination with detailed kinetic analysis of crystals,
conformational analysis in solution should be a valuable guide to discern enzyme 
mechanisms and select crystals for x-ray structure analysis.

Disorders of micturition in bacterial prostatitis.

Buck AC.

Measurements of urinary flow rate were performed in 16 patients with established 
prostatitis before and after a course of antimicrobial therapy. Before treatment 
the maximum flow rates were poor with abnormal flow curves and significant
improvement in voiding characteristics were observed with treatment (P less than 
0.01). A preliminary electrophysiological (EMG) study of sphincter activity
suggested that the obstruction to the flow of urine was at least in part due to
failure of the external sphincter to relax during micturition. Although the total
number of cases in this series was small the study showed that prostatitis was
associated with a disorder of micturition which correlated with the other
clinical features of the disease and could be objectively evaluated. Eradication 
of infection restored normal conditions in the lower urinary tract.

that the electrostatic interaction parameter of protein macroion and the number
sites of 5-HT fixing were smaller over an acid and base pH range as compared to
their values at neutral pH. Our data were interpreted by the conformational
changes which can be induced when BSA is exposed to denaturation by acid and
alkali pH.

Some psysicochemical properties of mitochondrial and cell sap alanine
aminotransferase from the rat CNS.

Ruscák M, Orlický J.

The authors describe different properties of brain mitochondrial and cell sap
alanine aminotransferase. They showed that the mitochondrial enzyme was inhibited
by maleate, chlorides, acetate and phosphate with a high ionic strength (over
1.8), that its pH optimum lay between 7.5 and 8.5, that it was thermolabile at
over 40 degrees C and that it was salted out from solutions with ammonium
sulphate at 0.6--0.8 saturation. The activity of the cell sap enzyme was
inhibited by phosphate at an ionic strength of only 0.12, less markedly by
maleate and not at all by chlorides and acetate; its pH optimum was about 8, it
was thermostable up to 60 degrees C and was precipitated from ammonium sulphate
solution at between 0.35 and 0.6 saturation. The authors conclude from their
results that two different alanine aminotransferase enzymes are present in the
CNS.

By means of two cases of postvaccinal encephalomyelitis following antirabies
vaccination has been demonstrated the meaning of these complications. In one of
these cases has been presumed a simultaneous illness of quiet rabies. The
difficulty of an aetiological diagnostic by the morphological effigy of the
encephalomyelitids has been referred. An improvement of the dispensaire-system

The effect of L-dopa on young patients with simple schizophrenia, treated with
neuroleptic drugs: a double-blind cross-over trial with Madopar and placebo.

Gerlach J, Lühdorf K.

Thirteen out of 18 young out-patients with simple schizophrenia under neuroleptic
treatment completed a double-blind cross-over trial with Madopar [L-Dopa +
benserazid (a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor)] and placebo. Nine patients
were given 900 mg L-Dopa + 225 mg benserazid daily, 1 patient received 600 mg
L-Dopa + 150 mg benserazid, and 3 patients, 300 mg L-Dopa + 75 mg benserazid. In 
these doses, L-Dopa was effective against emotional withdrawal, blunted affect,
tendency to isolation and apathy, without inducing or aggravating productive,
accessory symptoms. The activity score, according to the specific
activity-withdrawal scale, was significantly increased (P less than 0.05),
whereas the total BPRS score (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) was slightly, but
significantly reduced (P less than 0.05). In cases where L-Dopa had to be limited
to 600 and 300 mg daily, a tendency to anxiety, distortion of thinking, and a
sense of unreality were observed, depending on the dose of L-Dopa. In no case
were gastrointestinal, cardiovascular or neurological side-effects observed.

The specificity of binding of the narcotic agonist etorphine in synaptic
membranes of rat brain in vivo.

Mulé SJ, Casella G, Clouet DH.

When 3H-etorphine was administered to rats in a pharmacologically effective dose 
(0.75 mug/kg intracisternally), the labeled drug was concentrated in synaptic
membrane fractions isolated from the brains of rats killed 10 min after etorphine
injection. Pretreatment of the animals with the narcotic antagonists naloxone,
diprenorphine or l-cyclorphan, blocked the pharmacological responses to etorphine
and reduced 3H-etorphine binding in the membrane fractions. The differences
between 3H-etorphine bound in synaptic membranes of rats treated with
d-cyclorphan (inactive isomer) and l-cyclorphan (active antagonist) were in the
same range as the reductions in etorphine binding in antagonist-treated rats,
indicating that stereospecific and pharmacologically-specific binding sites in
synaptic membranes in vivo were of the same magnitude: about 0.04 pmol/g brain.

The cholinergic system and nociception in the primate: interactions with
morphine.

Pert A.

In Experiment 1 the shock titration task was used to evaluate the antinoceptive
properties of 5 different classes of cholinergic compounds in the rhesus monkey. 
Only scopolamine and high doses of physostigmine were effective in elevating the 
shock threshold. The apparent antinociceptive effect of physostigmine, however,
was difficult to separate from its nonspecific behavioral depressant effect and
was probably not related to an increase in cholinergic tone. Experiment 2
examined the interaction of morphine with arecoline, scopolamine and
physostigmine. Only scopolamine (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) and high doses of
physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) interacted with morphine in the shock titration
paradigm. The multiplicative interaction of morphine with scopolamine was
confirmed in Experiment 3 over a wider range of doses. It was concluded that
morphine and the cholinergic compounds produce antinociceptive effects through
different mechanisms of the pain system.

Effects of thienodiazepine derivatives on human sleep as compared to those of
benzodiazepine derivatives.

Nakazawa Y, Kotorii M, Oshima M, Horikawa S, Tachibana H.

The effects of new thienodiazepine derivatives, such as clotiazepam and Y-7131,
on normal human sleep were investigated on 5 subjects and compared to those of
benzodiazepine derivatives, such as diazepam and nitrazepam. REM sleep was
significantly decreased only with 2 mg of Y-7131 and rebound elevation of REM
sleep did not follow in recovery 1 and 2 nights. By using partial differential
REM deprivation which was designed by us, there was also no rebound elevation of 
REM sleep noted in recovery 2 nights following 2 mg of Y-7131 medication. REM
sleep was not suppressed with 15 mg of clotiazepam, 6 mg of diazepam and 10 mg of
nitrazepam when compared to the baseline night. With regard to NREM sleep, stage 
2 was significantly increased with 15 mg of clotiazepam and 10 mg of nitrazepam, 
but stage SWS was significantly decreased with 10 mg of nitrazepam.

Effect of two weeks' treatment with thioridazine, chlorpromazine, sulpiride and
bromazepam, alone or in combination with alcohol, on learning and memory in man.

Liljequist R, Linnoila M, Mattila MJ, Saario I, Seppälä T.

Forty paid healthy male students participated in two subacute experiments of 6
weeks each. In the first trial 20 of them received bromazepam, thioridazine, and 
placebo double blind cross over for 2 weeks each, and in the second trial the
active agents administered to the other 20 participants were chlorpromazine and
sulpiride. The tests used were paired associate learning with nonsense syllables 
and digit memory span. Before testing the subjects took either an alcoholic or a 
nonalcoholic bitter drink. As in the previous study from this laboratory, alcohol
was found to impair learning capacity. Of the drugs used only bromazepam impaired
learning significantly, and the combined effect of alcohol and bromazepam on
learning capacity was very deleterious. The adrenolytic effect of drugs did not
correlate with their effect on learning. Caution is necessary when prescribing
bromazepam for active outpatients at least in doses used in this study.

Effects of chronic exposure to stressors on avoidance-escape behavior and on
brain norepinephrine.

Weiss JM, Glazer HI, Pohorecky LA, Brick J, Miller NE.

A single exposure to a severe stressor (either cold swim or inescapable shock)
impairs subsequent performance in a shuttle avoidance-escape task (1), a deficit 
attributed to reduction in brain noradrenergic activity produced by these
stressors. In the present paper, two experiments are described which examine how 
repeated exposure to such stressors affects (a) shuttle avoidance-escape
performance (Experiment 1), and (b) aspects of brain norepinephrine metabolism
(Experiment 2). Experiment 1 showed that, whereas subjects receiving the single
exposure to cold swim or shock showed a large avoidance-escape deficit, subjects 
that received repeated exposure to these stressors for 14 days performed
similarly to the control group that received no stressor. Experiment 2 showed
that, whereas subjects that received one session of the inescapable shock
stressor showed a lower level of norepinephrine in hypothalamus and cortex than
did subjects that received no shock, subjects that received repeated exposure to 
inescapable shock or cold swim showed neurochemical "habituation." Subjects that 
received repeated shock showed elevated tyrosine hydroxylase activity and no
depletion of norepinephrine level, and both repeated shock and cold swim caused a
decrease in uptake of 3H-norepinephrine by slices of cortex in vitro. Thus, it is
concluded that the behavioral and neurochemical changes that were observed after 
the stressful conditions studied are consistent with the hypothesis that changes 
in avoidance-escape responding following exposure to these stressful events are
due to changes in brain noradrenergic activity.

Evaluation of combined pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment in
patients with functional abdominal disorders.

Schonecke OW, Schüffel W.

78 patients suffering from various functional abdominal complaints have been
trated in a 2 x 2 double-blind design: (a) psychotherapy with Ro 5-3350 (TH/Ro); 
(b) psychotherapy with placebo (TH/P); (c) Ro 5-3350 without psychotherapy
(NIH/Ro); (d) placebo without psychotherapy (NTH/P). Results show that a
considerable amount of improvement cannot be ascribed to the two critical factors
or the interaction of both, but are due to unspecific influences in the course of
treatment. Some of the results concerning the combination of TH and the
psychotropic drug pose interesting questions for further research and bare
implications for double-blind trials of psychotropic drugs. The results suggest
that possibly properties of any psychotropic drug have to be related to a
doctor-patient relationship within which the personal problems of the patient are
dealt with. In order to evaluate such properties, special methodological
precautions have to be taken. These will be briefly discussed.

Role of cardiovascular and ionic changes in pathogenesis and prevention of
isoprenaline-induced cardiac necrosis.

Strubelt O, Siegers CP.

Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen uptake, and blood values of PO2, PCO2, and pH 
were studied in unanesthetized rats for 8 hours. After a cardiotoxic dose of 20
mg/kg isoprenaline, s.c., blood pressure fell from 117 to 72 mm Hg, heart rate
accelerated from 326 to 497 beats/minute, and cardiac work diminished by about
15%. Metabolic rate increased by about 80%, blood values of PO2 rose, and those
of PCO2 fell somewhat, whereas blood pH dropped from 7.48 to 7.38, indicating
metabolic acidosis. Propranolol (40 mg/kg, i.p.) and verapamil (50 mg/kg, i.p.), 
both of which almost completely prevented isoprenaline-induced cardiac necroses, 
inhibited the chronotropic and calorigenic actions of isoprenaline by about 50%. 
While propranolol inhibited the depressor effect of isoprenaline completely,
verapamil enhanced it: blood pressure fell to 46 mm Hg. Isoprenaline-induced fall
of blood pH was not prevented by either propranolol or verapamil. Decrease of
blood pH and cardionecrotisation were enhanced when isoprenaline was given
together with 4.8 g/kg ethanol, p.o. In conclusion, hemodynamic actions of
isoprenaline, especially hypotension, seem to be nonessential for the production 
of cardiac necroses. Strong acidification can aggravate the cardiotoxicity of
isoprenaline.

Alterations in norepinephrine pattern in the damaged myocardium in the rat.

Bhagat B, Sullivan JM, Dhalla NS.

In the albino rat, the evolvement of myocardial necrosis induced by a single
injection of ISO was accompanied by a fall in total NE. Pretreatment with
propranolol and pargyline protected against ISO-induced necrosis and myocardial
hypertrophy, but did not influence the ISO-induced depletion of NE stores. The
depletion of NE stores is not due to impairment in synthesis or increased
intraneuronal metabolism of NE since, in ISO-treated rats, neither cardiac
tyrosine hydroxylase activity nor MAO activity was altered. The decrease in
endogenous NE is not due to a defect in the storage of NE. The ability of
myocardium to take up and store NE returned to normal within 48 hours, whereas
endogenous levels returned to normal within 5 days, even in the presence of
demonstrable necrosis. Thus, there is lack of correlation between chemical and
morphological changes, since catecholamine depletion occurred in the absence of
morphologically demonstrable tissue injury, and the function of the adrenergic
neuron returns to normal in the presence of demonstrable necrosis.

Prevention of myocardial Ca overload and necrotization by Mg and K salts or
acidosis.

Janke J, Fleckenstein A, Hein B, Leder O, Sigel H.

The crucial point in the pathogenesis of isoproterenol-induced myocardial
necrotization is an abundant intracellular Ca accumulation leading to high energy
phosphate exhaustion. Accordingly, in the early stage of the
isoproterenol-induced necrotization process, the onset of ATP and creatine
phosphate breakdown strictly parallels the acute Ca gain. In this type of
necrosis, the Mg losses from the myocardium appear as a concomitant phenomenon.
The hearts can be protected against the deleterious Ca overload and necrotization
by increasing the plasma concentration of Mg, K, or H ions in order to
counterbalance Ca according to the ration (see article). On the other hand, if
Mg, K, or H ion concentrations are too low, isoproterenol-induced Ca uptake and
myocardial lesions are potentiated.

Explanation of the stimulation of microsomal N-demethylation reactions by soluble
supernatant fraction.

Cinti DL.

Addition of the cell soluble supernatant fraction to an assay medium containing
NADPH generating system, mixed function oxidase substrate and microsomes,
resulted in a stimulation of drug metabolism ranging from 12-75%. This
stimulation was observed only when the supply of DADPH generating system
(isocitric dehydrogenase or glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase) was insufficient, 
leading to a NADPH oxidation rate which was greater than the rate of reduction of
NADP+ during the oxidation of a drug. Hence, under our assay conditions, the
soluble supernate (SS) is only providing sufficient NADPH generator, and possibly
relieving inhibition by the generated NADP+. Finally, microsomal lipid
peroxidation measurements under these same conditions indicate negligible to no
peroxidation activity in the absence of SS.

An attempt to correlated analgesia to changes in brain neuromediators in rats.

Gascon AL, Bensemana D.

The analgesic activity of delta9THC, morphine and sodium salicylate was studied
concomitantly with changes in brain stem levels of 5HT, 5HIAA, DA and NA. The
results show that a correlation exists between analgesia and changes in the
serotonergic system of the brain stem. Furthermore morphine sulfate was found to 
increase the DA concentration of the brain stem while delta9THC increased NA
levels. We conclude that serotonergic system may be of major importance in
analgesia while simultaneous changes in this system and/or the DA and NA systems 
may lead to a more pronounced analgesic activity.

Colorimetric determination of 5-aminosalicylic acid and its N-acetylated
metabolite on urine and feces.

Pieniaszek HJ Jr, BatesTR.

A simple and convenient colorimetric method is described for the quantitative
determination of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and N-acetyl-5-ASA in urine and
feces after oral administration of salicylazosulfa-pyridine (SASP), the drug of
choice in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. N-acetyl-5-ASA is extracted
directly from the acidified biological specimen, deacetylated, and the liberated 
5-ASA subjected to a modified Bratton-Marshall reaction. The 5-ASA present in the
specimen must be acetylated with acetic anhydride prior to extraction. The violet
colored product of the Bratton-Marshall reaction has a lambdamax of 560 nm and
conforms to Beer's law over the concentration range of 0-70 umg/ml. Average
recoveries (+/- S.D., N = 6) OF 5-ASA added to rat and human urine and rat fecal 
homogenates were 91.6 +/- 4.9%, 102 +/- 6.0%, and 71.0 +/- 4.8%, respectively.
Interference by SASP and its sulfapyridine metabolities is negligible. As
demonstrated, the colorimetric method is of sufficient sensitivity for
application in most metabolic and pharmacokinetic studies conducted with SASP in 
laboratory animals and man.

[Pressures, blood gases, pH, lactate and pyruvate concentrations in the portal
venous blood in patients after laparotomy during the first 9 days (author's
transl)].

[Article in German]

Eisele R, Dissmann W, Nasseri M, Thimme W.

In 24 patients (16 women, 8 men, mean age 60 years), who underwent abdominal
operations and who had a uncomplicated postoperative course, a teflon-tube was
inserted into the portal vein at the end of laparotomy and remained there for
maximal 9 days. The mean values of the portal venous pressure as well as of the
portal-central venous pressure gradient are unchanged during the period of all 9 
days and are between 7,4 and 7,9 mmHg, between 5,6 and 6,9 mmHg respectively. The
arterio-portal venous 0(2)-content difference shows in the mean no fluctuations
and is about 2 Vol.%. On the first postoperative day the lactic and pyruvic acid 
concentrations in the artery and portal vein are moderately, but significantly
elevated and decrease to normal values until day 7. - 9.

Biochemical and biophysical changes in guinea pigs after acute head injury.

Hausdoerfer J, Heller W, Schinkmann L.

Animal experiments were set up mainly to derive additional diagnostic data from
the study of biochemical changes after acute head injury. In standardized
experiments guinea pigs were subjected in groups of 20 to three identical head
injuries, each of either 1.0 J or 1.5 J intensity. The trauma was likely to
result in a concussion or contusion syndrome similar to that found in man; 40
animals served as controls. During the 60 min after injury observation and
measurement of body functions did not reveal signs of a shock-like condition or
hypoxaemia in the traumatized animals compared with control animals. Superficial 
anaesthesia probably did not influence the findings. Temperature and respiration 
were altered significantly in all the animals receiving head injuries. Blood gas 
analysis showed a decrease of standard bicarbonate only after the 1.5 J injury
but even though hypoxaemia was not present 2,3-diphosphoglycerate values and P50 
increased, compared with the control animals. The fall of plasma lipid
concentrations reported probably had to be seen as a sympathomimetic effect of
the minor (1.0 J) trauma. Of special significance was the increased activity of
malate dehydrogenase and aldolase, found only in the blood of severely
traumatized animals, as this could serve as an early diagnostic aid for
evaluating head injuries.

Total brain ischaemia in dogs: cerebral physiological and metabolic changes after
15 minutes of circulatory arrest.

Lind B, Snyder J, Safar P.

Cross-clamping of the ascending aorta in dogs for 15 min produced severe
neurological deficit, observed for up to 20 h. Immediately after restoration of
the circulation, the intracranial pressure in the cisterna magna increased
transiently to a mean peak of 22.8 Torr (SD +/- 1.7) because of a compensatory
increase in systemic arterial pressure, without a fall in cerebral perfusion
pressure. The intracranial pressure returned to control values 15-30 min after
ischaemia and showed no secondary rise during the 8 h of observation. The
electroencephalogram became isoelectric 34 +/- 6.5 s (mean +/-SD) after
circulatory occlusion, and was abnormal when it reappeared 5 h 36 min (SD +/- 2 h
4 min) after the circulation was restored. The electrical impedance of the brain 
increased immediately after ischaemia and returned rapidly towards pre-ischaemic 
values during re-perfusion. The cerebral water had not increased measurably 4 h
after ischaemia. After ischaemia, the lactate concentration in the cerebrospinal 
fluid increased to 4.7 mequiv./1(SEM +/-0.1) and the pH decreased to 7.17 (SEM
+/-0.02); both returned to control values after 3.5 h. The cerebral glucose
uptake was decreased 35 min after ischaemia, cerebral oxygen uptake remained
unchanged but cerebral blood flow decreased (P less than 0.05 at 90 min).
Immediately after cardiac arrest, recovery was impaired more by the presence of
focal abnormal brain perfusion than by intracranial hypertension.

Oxygen and carbon dioxide dissociation of duck blood.

Scheipers G, Kawashiro T, Scheid P.

Oxygen and CO2 dissociation of duck blood was studied in blood samples
equilibrated with known gas mixtures at the bird's body temperature (41 degrees
C) and analyzed in the Van Slyke manometric apparatus and in pH electrodes. At
various pH values between 7.38 and 7.55 the Hill plots yielded straight and
parallel lines over a wide range of O2 saturation, the Hill coefficient being
2.9. Half saturation pressure P50 at pH = 7.50 was 36 torr. The Bohr effect
factor was -0.53. Buffering properties were analyzed by equilibrating blood
samples with gas mixtures of different PCO2 at 41 degrees C. The buffer value for
whole blood in the range of 3-7% CO2 was 19.3 mMol-L-1-pH-1, the buffer value for
true plasma 22.9 mMol-L-1-pH-1. The CO2 dissociation curve constructed using the 
buffer values had a slope of 0.17 mMol-L-1-torr-1 in the PCO2 range from 40 to 50
torr. The CO2 content of oxygenated blood at PCO2 = 40 torr was 21.7 mMol-L-1.
The Haldane effect factor at PCO2 = 35 torr equalled 0.30 mMol of combined CO2
per mMol HbO2. With the values of PO2, PCO2 and pH measured in arterial blood of 
undisturbed and unrestrained, resting ducks effective dissociation curves for
both O2 and CO2 were constructed assuming a metabolic R.Q. of 0.8. These curves
are expected to resemble closely the actual in vitro dissociation curves of
resting ducks.

First apparent dissociation constant of carbonic acid, pK'1, of plasma and
erythrocytes.

Messier AA.

The first apparent dissociation constant of carbonic acid, pK'1, of plasma and
red cells was determined on venous blood of ten healthy, adult, male, human
subjects. pH and PCO2 of plasma and red cells were analyzed electrometrically and
a micromanometric method was used for the determination of total carbon dioxide
content. Erythrocyte carbamino hemoglobin levels were estimated and used for the 
correction of erythrocyte pK'1. Each blood sample was subjected to the following 
regimen before centrifugation, 1) As drawn from the antecubital vein, 2)
Oxygenated with a 5% CO2, O2 balance gas mixture, and 3) Reduced with a 5% CO2,
N2 balance gas mixture. pK'1 of plasma and red cells are presented: (see
article). The consistently larger values for red cell pK'1 than the respective
plasma data may be attributed to the greater amount of carbamino hemoglobin
concentration present in the erythrocytes. A simplified method for the
calculation of erythrocyte bicarbonate concentration using the experimentally
determined red cell pK'1 value has been formulated. The method involves the use
of a regression equation relating plasma and red cell pH, the equivalence of
plasma and red cell PCO2, along with the experimentally determined red cell pK'1.

The effects of changes in pH and PCO2 in blood and water on breathing in rainbow 
trout, Salmo gairdneri.

Janssen RG, Randall DJ.

The effect of sustained hypercapnia on the acid-base balance and gill ventilation
in rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, was studied. The response to an increase in
PICO2 from 0.3 to 5.2 mm Hg was a five-fold increase in gill ventilation volume
and a slight increase in breathing frequency. There was a concomitant rise in
PACO2 and an immediate fall in pHa. If PICO2 was maintained at 5.2 mm Hg for
several days, ventilation volume gradually returned to the initial,
prehypercapnic level within three days. Arterial pH also returned to the initial 
level within 2-3 days. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that
under these conditions fish regulate pH via HCO3/C1 exchange across the gills
rather than by changes in ventilation and subsequent adjustment of PACO2. A
reduction in environmental pH causes a reduction in pHa but only a slow gradual
increase in VG. Injections of HC1 or NaHCO3 into the blood have opposite effects 
on pHa but both cause a marked increase in VG. It is concluded that a rise in
PACO2 results in a rise in VG and that changes in pH in blood or water have
little direct effect on VG in rainbow trout. Possible location for receptors
involved in this reflex response are discussed.

The effect of pH upon fluoride uptake in intact enamel.

Friberger P.

The relationship between pH and fluoride uptake in intact enamel of permanent
premolars was investigated by using: (1) a sodium fluoride dentifrice, (2) a
potassium fluoride + manganese chloride dentifrice, and (3) a sodium fluoride
solution of the same fluoride concentration. The first part of this paper deals
with the in vitro uptake of fluoride from dentifrice slurries and from sodium
fluoride solutions of different pH ranging from 7.1 to 4.5. This investigation
showed that there was no significant difference between the agents but that the
effect of the pH was significant. The uptake of fluoride in the form of
fluorapatite was more than five times larger at the lower pH level. The second
part of the paper deals with the rate of fluoride uptake (increase in fluoride
content) from dentifrices in the same pH range. It was shown that the three
agents gave the same initial rate of fluoride uptake (about 50 parts/10(6)/min)
at pH 6 and that the rate of fluoride uptake in the outer layer of the enamel was
proportional to the hydrogen ion activity.

Determination of inorganic pyrophosphatase in rat odontoblast layer by a
radiochemical method.

Granström G, Linde A.

The enzyme inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPiase, EC 3.6.1.1) from the odontoblastic 
layer of rat incisors has been studied by means of a radiochemical micromethod.
The enzyme was incubated with 32P-pyrophosphate in tris-HCl buffer at 37 degrees 
C. The reaction was linear with time for at least 45 min, and the pH optimum was 
found to be 8.8, independent of the amount of pyrophosphate present. Heating the 
enzyme at 56 degrees C inhibited the enzyme activity rapidly, Mg2+ ions activated
the enzyme by 15% at an ion concentration of 4 mM, while higher concentrations
were inhibitory. Ca2+ ions and PO43-ions inhibited the enzyme at all
concentrations. F- ions did not affect the PPiase at concentrations below 8 mM,
whereas higher concentrations had an inhibiting effect. Urea was found to inhibit
the enzyme at concentrations above 1.5 M, while EDTA was a strong inhibitor at
very low concentrations. The characteristics of PPiase agree well with the
properties of the enzyme nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1.) studied
earlier.

Assessment of denture plaque pH in subjects with and without denture stomatitis.

Olsen I, Birkeland JM.

To evaluate the "resting" pH and induced pH changes in denture plaque, soft
deposits were collected from the fitting surface of the denture, pooled and
suspended in water. Plaque pH was determined with microelectrode equipment before
and after mouth rinsing with a sucrose solution. A characteristic level in the
"resting" pH of denture plaque was found in most of 12 subjects tested. pH values
below the baseline level were recorded for more than 2 h after a rinse. The pH
depressions were more pronounced in maxillary than in mandibular plaque. Further,
the pH minima tended to be lower in subjects with denture stomatitis than in
controls. No clear relationship could be established between the "resting" pH and
the concentration of Candida hyphae in denture smears or palatal inflammation.

Bioluminescence assay of enzymes obtained from buccal epithelium by superficial
scraping.

Hammar H, Wettermark G, Wladimiroff W.

A method is presented for the simultaneous assay of buccal enzymes by measuring
reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and adenosine triphosphate with the aid
of the bioluminescence of luciferase extracts. The activity of
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was shown earlier to be increased in
homogeneous leukoplakias of the oral mucosa. Since smoking has been implicated as
an etiologic factor of leukoplakia, G6PDH was measured in the normal buccal
epithelium of cigarette smokers. No difference was found in the activity of G6PDH
between smokers and nonsmokers when related to the activity of pyruvate kinase,
which is known to be invariable in healthy and leukoplakic oral mucosa. A new
compact kinetic luminescence analyzer is briefly described.

Allogeneic marrow transplantation for the treatment of leukaemia. A review.

Alvegård TA, Herzig GP, Graw RG Jr.

22 HL-A antigen and mixed leukocyte culture-matched sibling bone marrow
transplants were attempted in patients with acute leukaemia (at the National
Cancer Institute) to define the toxicities of four different immunosuppressive
regimens, the complications associated with warrow engraftment and antileukaemic 
effect. 73% (16/22) were engrafted as indicated by a change to donor red blood
cells (RBC) type, leukocyte, immunoglobulin allotype or by the speed of morrow
repopulation and the occurrence of the Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD). 12 of 16
(75%) successful engrafted patients developed GVHD. The current published results
of clinical bone marrow transplantation from major centers has been reviewed and 
will be discussed in relationship to current clinical complications associated
with bone marrow transplantation.

Current status of treatment of pneumonia.

Sabath LD.

Proper treatment of pneumonia is dependent upon a correct diagnosis. Pneumonia
may be due to infectious agents, allergic phenomena, or chemical causes.
Treatment regimens are outlined for the various types of pneumonia--pneumococcal,
staphylococcal, fungal, and pneumonia due to gram-negative and anaerobic
gram-negative bacilli, to Blastomyces dermatitidis, and to the parasite
Pneumocystis carinii. In discussing current concepts of treatment, several
well-known methods are emphasized, as well as newer developments, knowledge of
which is essential for optimal treatment of pneumonia.

'Picture frame' fibres in a carrier of the trait for malignant hyperpyrexia.

Isaacs H, Heffron JJ, Badenhorst M.

A member of a family which was known to be susceptible to malignant hyperpyrexia,
who was identified as a carrier by the presence of an elevated serum
creatine-phosphokinase, has been investigated further. Muscle was examined
biochemically, and the study included the sarcoplasmic ATPase-activity,
actinomycin, Mg2+ ATPase activity, ATP, phosphocreatine and glucose-6-phosphate. 
In addition, the calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum was studied. The
histochemical analysis of the muscle revealed the presence of a new fibre type
characterised by a dense rim of ATPase activity, which gives the impression of a 
'picture-frame'. Ultramicroscopic study revealed changes in the mitochondria and 
areas of myofibrillar disruption with swelling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Gastric emptying of liquids after different vagotomies and pyloroplasty.

Gleysteen JJ, Burdeshaw JA, Hallenbeck GA.

Gastric emptying of five liquid meals which differ in their physicochemical
properties have been measured in control dogs and dogs that have received a
Heinecke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty alone, proximal gastric vagotomy without drainage,
selective gastric vagotomy and pyloroplasty and truncal vagotomy and
pyloroplasty. The first two phases of emptying have been computed by the method
of least squares to obtain a logarithmic-linear pattern and are expressed as
relative rates: The initial post-ingestion process is characterized by beta or
the average relative rate of emptying in the first ten minutes, the basic or
exponential rate as beta and the change in rate from the initial to basic pattern
as deltabeta. Each measure of gastric emptying was statistically analyzed to
determine specific differences in rates between the operations studied. We
confirmed the earlier claims that pyloroplasty alone does not change the emptying
rate of liquid meals. Each measure or phase of emptying varies consistently
across the operations from meal to meal tested. Initial emptying after all three 
vagotomies is significantly faster than control with progressive rate increases
as proximal gastric vagotomy is compared with selective gastric vagotomy with
pyloroplasty and with truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty, probably indicative of 
gastric fundal loss of accommodation to volume distention after denervation. The 
basic exponential pattern of emptying is not lost after any of the operations
studied. The basic rate after proximal gastric vagotomy and selective gastric
vagotomy with pyloroplasty is nearly identical, slightly delayed from the control
rate and significantly slower than the more rapid rate after truncal vagotomy
with pyloroplasty. Possible explanations for these are discussed and imply a
particular importance of the hepatic and celiac vagal fibers, sectioned only with
truncal vagotomy, in the regulation of gastric emptying of liquids.

Pancreatic enzyme response with an elemental diet.

Neviackas JA, Kerstein MD.

Elemental diets can maintain or slightly improve the nutritional status without a
major stimulatory effect on the pancreas. Six dogs were maintained with a regular
chow diet, switched to an elemental diet and, subsequently, returned to a chow
diet. Cannulation of the pancreatic duct through a duodenal cutaneous fistula
revealed the enzyme response to be decreased in a dog maintained with an
elemental diet, with no or only a slight weight gain. Return to a regular diet
resulted in a return of pancreatic enzyme response.

Gastric fibrinolysis.

Nilsson IM, Bergentz SE, Hedner U, Kullenberg K.

Gastric juice from 15 normals, 20 patients with gastric ulcer and 14 patients
with erosive haemorrhagic gastroduodenitis was investigated in respect of its
activity on unheated and heated fibrin plates and its content of FDP and
plasminogen or plasmin with immunochemical methods. Gastric juice from normals
showed no activity on unheated and heated fibrin plates, and no FDP or
plasminogen could be demonstrated. In the patients with gastric ulcer the gastric
juice showed little or no fibrinolytic activity on fibrin plates except in 2, who
had regurgitation of duodenal juice and neutral pH of the juice. These patients
had equally high activity on heated as on unheated plates and no plasmin could be
demonstrated. It was shown that this activity was not due to fibrinolysis, but to
non-specific proteolytic activity (probably trypsin). The patients with erosive
haemorrhage gastroduodenitis exhibited quite a different picture. The gastric
juice from these patients showed extremely high activity on fibrin plates, the
activity was higher on unheated than on heated plates. The activity was inhibited
in vitro by addition of EACA and in vivo after administration of AMCA. The
occurence of plasmic could be demonstrated directly immunologically in the
gastric juice. By comparsion of plasmin and trypsin in various assays it could
further be improved that the gastric juice in these cases contained plasminogen
activator and plasmin. The patients with erosive haemorrhagic gastroduodenitis
showed no increase in fibrinolysis in the blood, but low values for plasminogen
and alpha2-M, and the serum contained FDP. These findings in the blood and
gastric juice were interpreted as signs of local fibrinolysis in the stomach and 
duodenum. There is reason to assume that this gastric fibrinolysis contributes
substantially to the bleeding tendency. The effect of administration of AMCA on
fibrinolytic activity and the haemorrhage lends support to the assumption of such
a mechanism.

Acid-base parameters in the dehydrated camel.

Yagil R, Etzion Z, Berlyne GM.

The effect of prolonged (10 days) dehydration on acid-base parameters of camel
blood was examined. The pH and PCO2 levels rose significantly in the course of
dehydration. This state was comparable with compensated non-respiratory alkalosis
found in other animals. The plasma sodium, and magnesium levels rose
significantly also. The plasma oxygen and calcium levels declined significantly. 
There were no significant changes in potassium and phosphate levels. It is
concluded that the changes found in acid-base status following dehydration are
further evidence of water preservation mechanisms in the dehydrated camel.

[Clinical experiences with untreated homologous vein grafts in reconstruction of 
arteries (author's transl)].

[Article in German]

Schulze-Bergmann G, Fernandez C.

50 transplantations of homologous vein grafts in reconstruction of arteries are
reported on. Vein grafts were either transplanted immediately or used after deep 
freezing. This procedure has proved to be effective in the replacement of
arteries during our observation period of four years. Results of homologous vein 
transplants are similar to those of autologous transplants.

The effect of a simulated subarachnoid hemorrhage on cerebral blood flow in the
monkey.

Martins AN, Doyle TF, Newby N, Kobrine AI, Ramirez A.

The hydrogen clearance method was used to measure local and total cerebral blood 
flow (CBF) in the rhesus monkey before and for five hours after a simulated
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). CBF remained stable after SAH unless SAH was
associated with a fall in cerebral perfusion pressure. In addition,
cerebrovascular resistance did not increase after SAH. These results suggest that
vasoactive agents in fresh whole blood, and the arterial spasm they produce when 
added to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), play only a limited role in the pathogenesis 
of ischemic encephalopathy that follows an SAH.

Effects of oxygen saturation and pCO2 on brain uptake of glucose analogues in
rabbits.

Berson FG, Spatz M, Klatzo I.

The effect of oxygen saturation and PCO2 on brain uptake of glucose analogues was
studied in rabbits. Using a modified Oldendorf technique, 14C-labeled glucose
analogues with a 3H2O reference standard were introduced into the cerebral
circulation via the common carotid artery, and the radioactivity of the
ipsilateral cerebral cortex was counted and expressed in terms of a brain uptake 
index (BUI). Severe hypoxia (oxygen saturation less than or equal to 18%)
resulted in approximately a 40% decrease in the BUI of 2-deoxy-D-glucose and a
45% decrease in the BUI of 3-0-methyl-D-glucose. Severe hypercapnia (PCO2 = 100
mm Hg) caused a 45% decrease in the BUI of both of these glucose analogues.
Hypercapnia superimposed on severe hypoxia had no additional effect. Hypocapnia
(PCO2 = 15 mm Hg) increased the BUI of 3-0-methyl-D-glucose by 35% of the control
value, and this increase was extremely sensitive to competitive inhibition. When 
BUI values were plotted against pH rather than PCO2 for the same experiments,
there was a good correlation with the calculated linear regression. These results
are compared with previous findings on pathologically induced changes in brain
uptake of glucose analogues, and the possible role of blood flow is considered in
detail.

Lactate and pyruvate concentrations, and acid-base balance of cerebrospinal fluid
in experimentally induced intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage in dogs.

Sugi T, Fujishima M, Omae T.

The effect of blood injected into either subarachnoid space or subcortical brain 
tissue upon lactate and pyruvate concentrations as well as acid-base balance of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was studied in the anesthetized dog. CSF lactate and
lactate/pyruvate ratio (L/P ratio) increased progressively following the
intracranial injection of blood and reached the maximum level at six hours after 
injection. These changes were significantly greater in animals with intracerebral
hematoma than in those with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). An increase in CSF
lactate and L/P ratio in hemorrhagic CSF seems to be caused by two different
factors. Shed blood cells per se produce lactate and pyruvate, and blood in the
subarachnoid space and intracerebral hematomas cause secondary changes in brain
tissue metabolism by a probable reduction of cerebral blood flow. Therefore, an
increase in CSF lactate with a concomitant rise in CSF L/P ratio is a useful
indicator for brain tissue hypoxia, even when CSF is hemorrhagic. The association
of an increase in CSF lactate to a disproportionate decrease in CSF HCO-3 was
also observed in these animals.

A study of variables affecting the quality of platelets stored at "room
temperature".

Kunicki TJ, Tuccelli M, Becker GA, Aster RH.

The effect of variables associated with the donor and with methods of collecting,
processing, and storing platelets on the quality of platelets kept at ambient
temperature was studied. Changes in structural integrity of platelets, decrease
in pH, loss of aggregability, and kinetics in vivo of platelets tagged with 51Cr 
were used as indicators of the tolerance of platelets to storage. A platelet
concentration of less than 2.5 x 10(6) per cu mm, a temperature of storage less
than 24 C, and continuous, gentle, agitation were found to be essential for
satisfactory preservation of platelet integrity, function, and post-transfusion
survival. Platelets from female donors tolerated storage less well than did
platelets from male donors, possibly because the lower hematocrit of blood
collection from females resulted in greater initial acidity of the concentrate. A
number of other variables analyzed appear to be of little or no consequence for
successful platelet storage.

Dopamine-containing neurons of the substantia nigra and their terminals in the
neostriatum.

Tennyson VM, Mytilineou C, Heikkila R, Barrett RE, Cohen G, Côté L, Duffy PE,
Marco L.

Tne ultrastructural and fluorescence histochemical characteristics of the mature 
rabbit substantia nigra and neostriatum have been reviewed as a frame of
reference for the developmental study. Biochemical investigations were reported
on neostriatal dopamine concentrations and the relative uptake and accumulation
of 3H-dopamine by this tissue from fetal to adult stages, to provide quantitative
data for correlation with the fluorexcence information. The development of the
neurons of the substantia nigra and their axons which project to the neostriatum 
has been presented from their appearance at day 14 of gestation to their
maturation in early postnatal life. The initial bipolar neuroblasts, which
develop in the midline of the caudal mesencephalon, are fluorescent as soon as
they emerge from the ependymal zone. Their fluorescent axons, which form the
nigroneostriatal pathway, reach the telencephalon at day 16 of gestation and
ramify extensively in the putamen by day 20, but do not enter the caudate nucleus
until several days later. Some of the early fluorescent axonal profiles in the
putamen are extremely large. Electron microscopic study of theis stage suggests
that the large fluorescent profiles may correspond to axonal growth cones or
early synapses. A distinct substantia nigra, pars compacta and reticulata, can be
recognized by fluorescence microscopy by day 20 of gestation. Electron microscopy
reveals that the young neurons are multipolar with numerous developing dendrites,
some of which exhibit early synaptic junctions. The subsequent maturaition of
these cells and the neuropil is described. The fluorescent axons of the
substantia nigra grow into the putamen and caudate nucleus in a nonuniform manner
forming fluorescent islands throughout the neostriatum in late fetal life.
Occasionally, minute beaded fluorescent axons are found. These profiles might
correspond to some of the axons with varicosities "en passage" revealed by
electron microscopy. In an attempt to identify further the dopamine-containing
axon, the ultratructure of adult neostriatum incubated in 5-hydroxydopamine was
reported. Axonal varicosities "en passage" containing a dense "tag" in the
vesicles were found. Most of the tagged boutons did not exhibit synaptic
contacts. The possible significance of these finding s as related to dopamine
secretion are discussed.

[Article in Ukrainian]

Martynenko FP, Sakhno TO.

A comparative study of rat adenohypophysis extract and its alcohol fractions was 
performed by two variants of the method of electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel:
at pH 9,5 and with the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate at pH 7.2. With the
presence of sodium dodecylsulphate four protein zones are found which in the
order from the anode towards the cathode are identified as hemoglobin,
somatotropin, lactotropin and albumin. It is shown that the somatotropin zone
after the extract separation at pH 9.5 is inhomogeneous and consists of
somatotropin and hemoglobin.

[Properties of NAD-glycohydrolase of the nuclei of the liver cells of rats].

[Article in Ukrainian]

Pakyrbaéva LV, Shushevich SI, Khalmuradov AH, Chahovets' RV.

Certain properties of the rat liver cell nuclei NAD-glycohydrolase (EC 3.2.2.5)
were investigated. It is established that its highest activity is at 37 degrees
with activation energy equal to 9480 cal/M and with factor Q10 equal to 1.5. The 
enzyme pH optimum in 0.2 M tris acetate is equal to 6.5 and in 0.2 potassium
phosphate - 7.5. It was shown that the enzyme manifests its strict specificity
only with beta-NAD, and it hardly decomposes NADP without affecting NADH, NADPH
and NMN. The apparent Km value of the enzyme with respect to NAD is established. 
Isonicotinic acid hydrazide, nicotinamide and to the less extent nicotinic acid
inhibit the enzymatic activity of nuclei. EDTA, EGTA, p-CMB, mercaptoethanol do
not cause any changes in the rat liver cells nuclei NADase activity.

A comparative study was carried out of some properties of "soluble" Na+,
K+-ATPase obtained from different subcellular membrane brain structures by means 
of non-ionic detergents of triton X-100 and digitonin. It is established that
temperature and pH-optima of "soluble" Na+, K+-ATPase are close to these optima
of the initial membrane preparations. A certain difference is observed in the
dynamics of temperature and pH-dependence of Na+, K+-ATPase activity in the
extracts from different subcellular structures. The stability of the preparations
in storage was investigated. A conclusion is made that more stable enzyme
extracts may be obtained by means of digitonin.

[Biosynthesis of flavins and its regulation in the yeast Pichia guilliermondii].

[Article in Russian]

Shavlovsky GM, Lohvynenko EM, Struhovshchykova LM, Kashchenko VE.

The nature of riboflavin precursors was studied in the yeast Pichia
guilliermondii. By means of mutants with blocked GMP-synthetase the purine
precursors of riboflavin were shown to belong to guanylic compounds. Accumulation
of 2,4,5-triamino-6-oxypyrimidine, 2,5-diamino-6-oxy-4-ribitylaminopyrimidine,
2,6-dioxy-5-amino-4-ribitylaminopyrimidine (DOARAP) and
6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumasine occurs in the riboflavin-deficient mutants divided
into five biochemical groups. This fact evidences for identity of riboflavin
precursors in the yeast P. guilliermondii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synthesis
of DOARAP by the washed off cells of the mutants with the blocked lumasine
synthetase is strongly inhibited by riboflavin; cycloheximide in the absence of
riboflavin has no effect on this process. Consequently, flavinogenesis in P.
guilliermondii is regulated according to the type of negative feedback by means
of retroinhibition mechanism. A change in the content of flavins in the cells has
no effect on synthesis of riboflavin synthetase; at the same time iron deficiency
in the cells evokes derepression of this enzyme. Incubation of the cells rich in 
iron with o-phenantroline or alpha, alpha'-dipyridyl also causes derepression of 
riboflavin synthetase which is inhibited by cycloheximide. A deficiency of hem in
the mutants which need epsilon-aminolevulinic acid does not affect the
riboflavinsynthetase activity of the cells. Evidently, in P. guilliermondii a
certain form of nonheminic iron might take part in regulating synthesis of
riboflavin synthetase and other enzymes participating in riboflavin biosynthesis.
Riboflavin overproduction is established to require formation of purines de novo.
With the absence of flavinogenesis enzymes derepression a genetic disturbance in 
regulation of purinic nucleotides biosynthesis results in stimulation of
flavinogenesis. The properties were studied for 680 time purified
riboflavinkinase from cells of P. guilliermondii as well as for three
phosphatases possessing the optimum of the activity at pH 3.5, 5.5 and 8.6, which
ARE ABLE OF HYDROLYSING FMN. A change in the content of flavins and iron in the
cells has no effect on the activity of riboflavinkinase in this species.
Evidently, the mechanisms of riboflavin and flavin nucleotides biosynthesis
regulation would be different in P. guilliermondii.

[DNases and RNases of Misgurnus fossilis ovocytes].

[Article in Ukrainian]

Kusen' SJ, Oleshko PS.

The pH optima were determined for DNases and RNases of the loach eggs. For DNases
they are 5.6 and 7.6 and for RNases - 5.2 and 7.2. It is established that Ca++
activates, and Fe++ has not effect on the activity of acid and alkaline DNases,
while Mg++, Mn++ and especially Co++, Zn++, Cd++, Cu++ have an inhibitory effect 
on them. The activities of RNases is stimulated by Ca++ and Fe++, and inhibited
by Zn++, Co++, Cd++ and Cu++. Iones Mg++ and Mn++ do not affect these activities.
Localization of the above mentioned enzymes was studied by means of differential 
centrifugation of egg homogenates. Acid DNase is concentrated only in
postmicrosomal supernatant liquid, its activity being inhibited in the presence
of the nucleomitochondrial and microsomal fractions. Acid RNase is also localized
predominantly in postmicrosomal supernatant fraction. Alkaline DNase is found to 
a great extent in nucleomitochondrial fraction, and alkaline RNase - in
postmicrosomal one.

[Determination of optimal conditions for the electron-cytochemical detection of
ATPase activity in isolated nuclei].

[Article in Ukrainian]

Konoplytska OL, Sytnyanska NP.

The optimal conditions are selected for electron-cytochemical detection of the
ATPase activity in nuclei of the skeletal muscles of rabbits and nuclei of Vicia 
faba L. meristem. It is shown that the previous fixation of nuclei in the rabbit 
skeletal muscle for 10 min in a mixture of the buffer solutions of 4% glutaric
dialdehyde and 4% neutral formalin (1:1) causes a decrease in their ATPase
activity by 78% in the medium containing Mg2+ and by 34% - in the medium
containing Ca2+; in nuclei of horse bean seedlings meristem it lowers
respectively by 28 and 16%. Ions of lead in a concentration of 0.4 mM evoke a
decrease in the ATPase activity in the medium containing Mg2+, in nuclei of the
rabbit skeletal muscles by 35% and in nuclei of horse bean meristem by 15% in the
medium containing Ca2+. The vaule of the residual activity is sufficient for
detection of the product of ATP enzymic hydrolysis reaction by activity is
sufficient for detection of the product of ATP enzymic hydrolysis reaction by the
method of electronic cytochemistry. An increase in the Pb2+ concentration higher 
than 2.8 mM evokes nonenzymic hydrolysis of ATP. The ATPase activity under the
electron-cytochemical study is found within the range of pH 6.3-8.5. The product 
of reaction forms most intensively at pH 7.2-7.5 in the medium with both Mg2+ and
Ca2+.

Kirillov AL, Knirik GS, Bazarevich GIa.

In experiments on 30 animals and in observations over the course of acute closed 
craniocerebral trauma in 24 patients is was found that the course and prognosis
of a posttraumatic period were dependent on the functional activity of the
sympathoadrenal system and cholin- and serotoninergic processes. Based on the
data obtained, it is concluded that the character of neurohumoral interrelations 
can serve as the prognostic criterion in craniocerebral traumas, whereas the
information about these processes--in selecting the appropriate therapy.

[Incarcerated gallbladder in cholecystitis].

[Article in Russian]

D'iachenko PK, Serdiuk IA.

Among 206 examined patients with cholecystitis and similar diseases in 112 (65%) 
cases, as evidenced by the authors' findings, the gallbladder proved to be
non-functioning. Its escape in the biliary system was functional (indirect) or
organic (absolute). The main causes of a direct organic escape of the gallbladder
are as follows: destructive changes in its walls, strictures, strangulated gall
stones, shrinkage or hydropsy. The reliable preoperative diagnosis of an escaped 
gallbladder by means of accelerated chromoduodenal catheterization, intravenous
(infusion-drip) or associated (intravenous-peroral) cholecystocholangiography,
correlated with the anamnesis data and clinical signs, rather speaks in favour of
cholecystectomy on absolute indications.

[Determination of the proteolytic activity of beef liver by means of natural
substrates labed with 125 I].

[Article in Slovak]

Blahovec J, Ondrus I.

There is a description of the determination of the enzymatic activity of acid
proteinases: the method is based on the use of 125J-labelled natural protein
substrates. Labelled albumin 125J, globulin 125J, and insulin 125J were tested
for the determination of activities. All the substrates were hydrolyzed with the 
enzymes of the supernatant fraction (106 000 g) of beff liver homogenate in the
zone of acid pH. Optimum comditions of enzymatic reaction were tested, the
dependence of reaction on the concentration of the enzyme, on time, and on
temperature was determined, pH optimum was ascertained for individual substrates,
and pH stability was determined. It follows from the results that the method is
suitable for the determination of the enzymatic activity of proteinases of the
cathepsin character.

Significance of serum pepsinogen and abomasal pH levels in a field infection of O
circumcincta in lambs.

Thomas RJ, Waller PJ.

Serum pepsinogen estimations from serially bled lambs grazing on pasture from
spring to autumn showed correlations with the availability of Ostertagia larvae
on pasture, with faecal egg counts of O circumcincta, and with Ostertagia worm
counts in similar lambs slaughtered fort-nightly from the same pasture. In the
slaughtered lambs correlations were recorded between worm count, serum pepsinogen
level and abomasal pH. The value of serum pepsinogen estimations as a diagnostic 
test is discussed with reference to these findings.

[Cultivation of Trichomonas gallinarum and Trichomonas tenax on a trimed medium].

[Article in Bulgarian]

Tsvetkova A, Iankov N, Dorevska K.

Studied was the possibility to isolate and culture Tr. gallinarum and Tr. tenax
on a medium Trimed, proposed by the authors for the isolation and cultivation of 
Tr. vaginalis. The growth and development of the two Trichomonas species were
followed up at various temperatures -- 38 degrees, 36 degrees, and 32 degrees C, 
in order to establish the most appropriate temperature for continuous cultivation
at longer intervals of reseeding as well as the temperature optimum for the fast 
deposition of great amounts of biomass. It was found that the Trimed medium is
suitable for the isolation and cultivation of Tr. gallinarum and Tr. tenax.
Temperatures of 38 degrees and 36 degrees contribute to the accumulation of
greater amounts of biomass, while at 32 degrees C the growth of these protozoa is
delayed and reseeding is to be carried out at greater intervals.

Amylase of the thermophilic actinomycete Thermomonospora vulgaris.

Allam AM, Hussein AM, Ragab AM.

alpha-Amylase of the thermophilic actinomycete Thermomonospora vulgaris was
partially purified. Maximal enzyme activity was obtained at 60degreeC and pH 6.0.
KM value was l.4%. The effect of some metal salts on enzyme activity was studied.
Enzyme activity was inhibited by by KCN, EDTA, and iodoacetate. Inhibition by
EDTA was completely nullified by CaCl2, but the inhibition by iodoacetate was not
overcome by 2-mercaptoethanol. Exposure of the enzyme to pH 7.0 and 9.0 for 2 hr.
did not affect the enzyme, but exposure to pH 3.0 for few minutes completely
inactivated the enzyme. Exposure of the enzyme to 60degreeC resulted in an
appreciable inactivation and exposure to 80degreeC completely inactivated the
enzyme. Addition of CaCl2, 2-mercaptoethanol, or enzyme substrate the 60degreeC
exposed enzyme. However, bovine serym albumin had a protective effect when the
enzyme was exposed to 60degreeC but not to 80degreeC. The enzyme was stable in
the presence of 8 M urea.

[The effect of therapeutic gentamycin doses on the enzyme secretion in urine].

[Article in German]

Burchardt U, Peters JE, Gründig CA.

8 patients with chronic pyelonephritis were given gentamycin intramuscularly
injected in individual dosage during 8-10 days. Here the behaviour of the
excretion of protein, alanine aminopeptidase alkaline phosphatase,
alpha-glucosidase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and lysozyme with the urine was 
tested. With the exception of the lysozymuria, which increased only in patients
with chronic renal insufficiency, regularly a hyperenzymuria developed. Most
distinctly the excretion of the alanine aminopeptidase increased. After initial
decrease the excretion of total protein transiently increased after completion of
the gentamycin therapy. All the deviations were reversible. From the increased
excretion of enzymes may not be concluded to a nephrotoxicity of gentamycin.

[Alkaline phosphatases in human feces, intestinal mucosa and bile, and the
occurrence of 5'-nucleotidase in feces (author's transl)].

[Article in German]

Benić V, Fiser-Herman M.

Alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) in extracts of human feces resembles alkaline
phosphatase in extracts of duodenal mucosa, except for its electrophoretic
mobility in starch gel. It is very probable that the normal feces alkaline
phosphatase derives from intestinal mucosa. Gall bladder alkaline phosphatase,
which is markedly different, has not been found in normal feces. Some patients
with acute viral hepatitis or protozoasis excrete an alkaline phosphatase which
resembles gall bladder alkaline phosphatase and has the characteristics of
5'-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5). The appearance of this enzyme correlates with low
total alkaline phosphatase activity of the excreta.

Simultaneous determination of 5'-nucleotidase and alkaline phosphatase activities
in serum.

El-Aaser AA, El-Merzabani MM.

A simple method is described for the simultaneous determination of alkaline
phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) and 5'-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5) in serum. The method is
based on the determination of inorganic phosphorus released by the action of the 
two enzymes on adenosine-5'-monophosphate at pH 9.5 (200 mmol/l tris-buffer) in
the presence and absence of L-cysteine. This amino acid at a concentration of
2--10 mmol/l was found to be a specific inhibitor for alkaline phosphatase but
with no effect on 5'-nucleotidase activity.

Absorption of short and medium chain fatty acids in the jejunum of the rat.

Naupert C, Rommel K.

The uptake of the shortest six fatty acids (acetic to octanoic) was studied in
vitro, using everted segments of rat jejunum. The marked influence of medium-pH
and fatty acid chain-length suggests that non-ionic diffusion through the lipoid 
membrane is quantitatively the most important way of transport, but ionic
diffusion through the membrane as well as transport through hydrophilic pores
also seem to play a role. Though fatt acids evidently are accumulated in the
tissue-fluid, and saturation kinetics, competitive inhibition and sodium- as well
as energy-dependence apparently are observed, the transport mechanism is assumed 
to involve solely passive diffusion, - the concept of a carrier-mediated
transport for short and medium chain fatty acids seems improbable.

Carcinogenic N-nitro-dimethylamine from the reaction of the analgesic amidopyrine
and nitrite extracted from foodstuffs.

LaBar J, Sander J.

The reaction of the analgesic amidopyrine (100 mg) with nitrite extracted from
cured meats and from spinach in varying degrees of spoilage was studied. Unde
physiological conditions the carcinogenic dimethylnitrosamine was formed at
milligram levels at nitrite concentrations as low as 4 mg (in 175 ml extracted
from 100 g boiled ham). The rate of decrease in concentration in the human
stomach after ingestion of amidopyrine and of nitrite contained in boiled ham or 
in a broth from boiled ham was also measured.

Histochemical observations on the occurrence of glycolytic and pentose phosphate 
cycle enzymes in the hepatopancreas and their possible relation to eyestalk
factor(s) in the crab Scylla serrata (Forskal).

Rangneker PV, Momin MA.

Histochemical studies were carried out on some of the glycolytic enzymes viz.
phosphorylase, aldose, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GPDH) and
lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and a key enzyme of the pentose phosphatase cycle,
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH), in the hepatopancreas of Scylla
serrata (Forskal). 1. Weak activities of phosphorylase and aldolase and
strong-activities of alpha-GPDH and LDH were noticed mainly in the brush border
of the tubules and R-cell cytoplasm. A trace activity of G-6-PDH was noticed in
the brush border. 2. Bilateral eyestalk removal results in inhibition of both
phosphorylase and aldolase. However, enhanced activities of alpha-GPDH and LDH
were noticeable 4 h after the operation. The G-6-PDH activity remained unaltered 
till 24 h. 3. Injection of eyestalk extract into both intact and destalked crabs 
activated all the enzymes.

[Article in German]

Pozsonyi L, Csornai A.

Authors applied blood-gas analysis in 30 healthy gravid women on 3,3 occassions
making out 90 cases altogether by blood samples taken from the pulp of the finger
capillaries. As a control 27 healthy non-gravid women were examined for
comparative analysis. In 10 cases between the 16. and 28. week the results of
samples taken from the arteria femoralis and the pulp were evaluated. It has been
found that in the gravidity period of the 16. and 28. week respiratory alcalosis 
does not appear. No metabolic changes have been found during the whole period of 
pregnancy. The parallel examination of blood samples taken from the arteria
femoralis and the pulp have proved that it is sufficient and reliable to take
blood-gas analysis on the material gained from the pulp capillary only. A special
importance is attached to keeping to exact methodical prescriptions.

[The cathode bound group antigen of dysentery-provoking escherichieae (author's

[Article in German]

Stenzel W.

Antigens from disrupted cells of dysentery-provoking and of non-enteropathogenic 
Escherichieae were submitted to immunoelectrophoresis on cellulose acetate
stripes at pH 8.0. Among 6 immune sera produced for this purpose by immunizing
rabbits against desintegrated dysentery bacteria, only one contained a
precipitine reacting with an antigen similar to the "generic antigen" of BELAYA. 
This - at pH 8.0 - cathode-bound group antigen (KGA) could not only be found in
virulent but also in 5 attenuated cultures and in 5 from 6 avirulent strains of
several dysentery types. Only the - apathogenic - type culture 1111/55 of
dysentery-provoking E. coli O 136 showed no KGA-reaction. Some sources of
methodical errors responsible for false outcomes of immunopherogrammes have been 
discussed.

Bordetella and a study of their properties. I. The formation of mureinoplasts and
true protoplasts from B. pertussis].

[Article in Russian]

Zakharova MS, Gureeva AA, Pereverzev NA.

B. pertussis suspension was tested by De Voe et al. method (1970) and its
modification with the solutions of a definite ionic composition and a lysozyme.
The best results were obtained by the following modification elaborated by the
authors. The microbes were grown on the casein-carbon agar for 36 hours and were 
washed with chilled 0.5 M NaCl. The suspension was washed 4 times with the same
solution and then the precipitate was suspended in saccharose solution (0.5 M).
In 2 hours the saccharose was replaced by a solution of salts with lysozyme.
After a 2-hour incubation at 35 degrees C the substance was centrifugated for 20 
minutes and the precipitate suspended in the tris-buffer at pH 7.8. The following
changes were observed: after the washing and incubation with saccharose there was
seen a strong stretching and separation of the cell wall (CW) from the
cytoplasmic membrane (CPM); cells without the CW were rarely revealed; 2) after
the lysozyme treatment there were many cells of spherical shape (phasic-contrast 
microscopy) without any CW, limited by the CPM only. Morphologically they were no
different from the true protoplasts of the Gram-positive bacteria. The chemical
analysis also confirmed a possibility of obtaining the true protoplasts of the
Gram-negative bacteria.

[Sympathico-adrenal system activity in a primary immune response].

[Article in Russian]

Vasina IG, Frolov EP, Serebriakov NG.

Experiments were carried out on linear mice immunized with sheep erythrocytes; it
was found that the primary immune respose developed against the background of
significant changes in the state of the sympathico-adrenal system, whose activity
was determined by the dynamics of catecholamines in the blood and in the tissues 
of a number of organs, including the thymus, the spleen and the lymph nodes. By
comparing the value of specific and neurohumoral indices it was revealed that the
neurohumoral shifts preceded the maximal development of the immune response. On
the example of studying the catecholamine dynamics the opinion on a close
association between the state of the regulatory mechanisms and the effector
formations responsible for the formation of specific immunological reactions was 
confirmed. It is suggested that a full-value immunological response developed on 
condition of activation of the sympathico-adrenal system.

[Covalent binding of peroxidase to CH- and AH-Sepharose 4 B].

[Article in German]

Schell HD, Mateescu MA.

The properties of peroxidase insolubilized by covalent binding to CH- and
AH-Sepharose 4 B in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)
carbodiimide (EDC) are described. CH-Sepharose 4 B bound peroxidase yields an
enzyme preparation with a residual specific activity of 60.6%. When bound to
AH-Sepharose 4 B, the residual specific activity is to 78%. The reasons of these 
differences in the catalytic activity of the two insolubilized enzyme
preparations are discussed. By covalent binding on CH- and AH-Sepharose 4 B,
peroxidase exibits no changes in its pH optimum; it virtually keeps the same
activity after being used ten times. Insolubilized peroxidase preparations, dried
and reimbibed after being stored for 6 weeks at room temperature still display
50% of the initial specific activity of the insolubilized enzyme. Stored in
acetate buffer, the enzyme preparations maintain their activity during all this
interval.

Aerobacter aerogenes PRL-R3 urease. Purification and properties.

Kamel MY, Hamed RR.

A method for the preparation of a 150-fold purified and homogenous A. aerogenes
urease is reported. The enzyme exhibited two pH optima at pH 7.0 and 7.5 in
triethanolamine and phosphate buffer, respectively. The affinity of the enzyme
toward its substrate increased with the increase of pH. No effect of the pH was
observed on the measured temperature coefficient (Q10). There was no
discontinuity in the Arrhenius plots at pH 5.4 and 7.5 but an upward
discontinuity at pH 6.15 and 8.7 with transition temperature at 30 degrees C.
Also, the calculated activation energies are greatly affected by the pH of the
enzyme reaction mixture.

Further characterization of the association of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase with reticulocyte membranes.

Letko G, Bohnensack R.

1. The behaviour and properties of membrane-bound GAPDH of rabbit reticulocytes
were investigated. 2. The bound GAPDH is more resistant to inactivation by KCl
than the soluble enzyme (allotopy). 3. The bound enzyme is released by
electrolytes. This effect does not only depend on the ionic strength but
additionally on the kind of ions, pH-value and protein concentration. 4. A
comparison of the releasing effect of NAD analogues shows the necessity of the
5'-AMP moiety in the structure of the effector. 5. The represented results
demonstrate the specifity of the GAPDH-membrane binding in rabbit reticulocytes.

[Effect of the vagus nerve on isolated rabbit atria in ganglionic blockade due to
hexamethonium].

[Article in German]

Weiss E.

By quantitative stimulation of the vagus nerves of isolated rabbit atria
frequency-response relations were obtained for both the electrotropic effect
(reduction of the area of the monophasic action potential) and the inotropic
response. An addition of hexamethonium in a final concentration of 10(-5) g/ml
resulted in a diminution of vagal effectivity in the range of lower and medium
frequencies of stimulation, and was connected with a shift of the
frequency-response characteristic to the right. At higher frequencies vagal
effectivity was increased. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of hexamethonium 
the facilitating action is irreversible. By raising the concentration up to
4-10(-5) g/ml the vagal effects were reduced to a large extent, and the frequency
dependence of the response was abolished at medium frequencies. In the range of
20 sec(-1) to 100 sec(-1) this dependence was re-established and may be
considered as a part of a normal frequency-response relation extremely shifted to
the right. The time courses of both types of effect are characterized by a steep 
rise and a decay of the response during the stimulation period. A mathematical
handling of the frequency-response characteristics provides quantitative evidence
for the extent of the hexamethonium blockade of vagal ganglion cells in the
atria; furthermore it leads to the conception of these cells to act as a
distributing system for a homogeneous innervation by a widespread divergency of
postganglionic fibres.

Chemical relaxation studies on the system liver alcohol dehydrogenase, NADH and
imidazole.

Czerlinski GH, Wagner M, Erickson JO, Theorell H.

Several years ago, Theorell and Czerlinski conducted experiments on the system of
horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and 
imidazole, using the first version of the temperature jump apparatus with
detection of changes in fluorescence. These early experiments were repeated with 
improved instrumentation and confirmed the early experiments in general terms.
However, the improved detection system allowed to measure a slight concentration 
dependence of the relaxation time of around 3 ms. Furthermore, the chemical
relaxation time was smaller than the one determined earlier (by factor 2). The
data were evaluated much more rigorously than before, allowing an appropriate
interpretation of the results. The observed relaxation time is largely due to
rate constants in an interconversion of ternary complexes, which are faster than 
three (of the four) dissociation rate constants, determined previously by
Theorell and McKinley-McKee.1,2 This fact contributed to earlier difficulties of 
finding any concentration dependence. However, the binding of imidazole to the
binary enzyme-coenzyme complex can be made to couple kinetically into the
interconversion rate of the two ternary complexes. The observed signal derives
largely from the ternary complex(es). A substantial fluorescence signal change is
associated with the observed relaxation process, suggesting a relocation of the
imidazole in reference to the nicotinamide moiety of the bound coenzyme. Nine
models are considered with two types of coupling of pre-equilibria (none-all).
Quantitative evaluations favor the model with two ternary complexes connected by 
an interconversion outside the four-step (bimolecular) cycle. The ternary complex
outside the cycle has much higher fluorescence yield than the one inside. The
interconversion equilibrium is near unity for imidazole. If it would be shifted
very much to the side of the "dead-end" complex (as in isobutyramide?!),
stimulating action could not take place.

Comparative study of virological infections in asthmatic and nonasthmatic
children.

Cernelc D, Gerbec M, Cernelc P.

The author shows complex analyses: clinical, laboratory, X-rays, bronchoscopical,
bronchographical and measuring lung function tests as well as the serological
examinations in blood serum of both groups of asthmatic and nonasthmatic children
with virological infection. The calculation of statistically significant
differences between the various diagnostical results of both groups has confirmed
that in asthmatic children virological infection of the respiratory tract,
pathological findings in X-ray and lung function tests, bronchiectasis and
secondary bacteriological invasion occurs statistically significantly more often 
than in nonasthmatic children.

Acute otitis media. A clinical bacteriological and serological study of children 
with frequent episodes of acute otitis media.

Branefors-Helander P, Dahlberg T, Nylén O.

A series of episodes of acute otitis media was studied with reference to
bacterial findings and specific serological responses in 48 children with
histories of frequent episodes before. D. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were the
most frequently isolated pathogens. Re-isolations after therapy were often made
in episodes with slow healing or therapeutic failure. Most children harboured
pathogens in nasopharynx even when they had no signs of respiratory tract
infections. Homologous relapses were seen only in few cases and never with
pneumococcus type 3 and only once with H. influenzae type b. Specific serological
responses were demonstrable generally in children over 2 years of age. D.
pneumococcus type 3 and H. influenzae type b generally provoked antibody
response. No levels indicating immunoglobulin deficiencies could be found in the 
children.

Multiple forms of staphylococcal alpha-toxin.

Dalen AB.

A group of proteins was readily extracted at neutrality from trichloroacetic acid
precipitates of staphylococcal culture filtrate supernatants, while alpha-toxin
was dissolved and activated by treating the precipitate with 8 M urea, with
acidic buffers or by heating to 90-100 degrees C at neutrality. Heat activation
of the precipitate produced a relatively pure alpha-toxin with a molecular weight
of 39,000. alpha-Toxin was eluted together with three other proteins on hydroxyl 
apatite chromatography, and evidence was obtained for an association between the 
four proteins. On isoelectric focusing a haemolytic fraction was obtained at pH
6.2, probably due to acid activation of the precipitate formed at the cathodic
end of the column. The alpha-haemolytic fractions with pI's of 7.4 and 8.6 were
shown to consist of alpha-toxin only when analyzed by acrylamide electrophoresis 
in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate. The haemolytic component with a pI of
9.2 contained two additional components of molecular weights of 27,500 and
18,000. Chromatography of this material on Sephadex G-200 showed that alpha-toxin
and the two proteins appeared as a high molecular complex.

Endosymbiosis and cellular tolerance in the Hawaiian soft coral Sarcothelia
edmondsoni verrill.

Mercer EH, Singh AP.

The relationship between the soft coral Sarcothelia edmondsoni Verrill and its
symbiotic algae is considered as an early instance of cellular tolerance which
can be disturbed by a variety of adverse conditions. The algal cells lie in
vesicles deep within the endodermal cells of the host and are not subject to
digestion. Their expulsion appears to be a reverse translocation to the distal
end of the host cell and escape by a form of reversed phagocytosis resembling
secretion. The cellular mechanisms involved are not clear.

Epidemiologic investigations of the 1969 epidemic of Venezuelan encephalitis in
Ecuador.

Gutierrev E, Monath TP, Alava A, Uriguen D, Arzube M, Chamberlain RW.

An epizoodemic of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), subtype I variant B,
occurred in Ecuador during the rainy and hot season of 1969. In this paper, a
general description of the epidemic is given and virus isolations from humans are
reported. A serologic survey was performed in order to determine the extension of
the epidemic along the coastal zone of the country. It is not clear whether the
higher antibody rate in older people was because they were at greater risk of
infection or was the result of an accumulated immunity with time. The latter
could be an indication of endemic virus activity, not yet proven for the VEE IB
virus variant. Mosquito surveillance and attempted control by aerial spraying
were carried out.

Congenital malformations of the central nervous system produced by narcotic
analgesics in the hamster.

Geber WF, Schramm LC.

Maternal dose--fetal teratogenic response data were obtained for a variety of
narcotic and related compounds by single subcutaneous injections of the drugs
into pregnant hamsters during the critical periods of central nervous system
organogenesis. The number of abnormal fetuses from females injected with
diacetylmorphine (heroin), thebaine, phenazocine, pentazocine, propoxyphene, and 
methadone increased as the maternal dose of the compounds was increased. By
contrast, morphine, hydromorphone, and meperidine produced an increase in the
number (per cent) of fetal anomalies only up to a certain maternal dose level.
Further increases in maternal dose levels did not produce additional fetal
anomalies. Comparative studies of single and multiple maternal doses indicated
that diacetylmorphine (heroin) and methadone produced a four- to sixfold increase
in fetal anomalies with repetitive doses whereas the percentage of malformed
fetuses remained the same with hydromorphone (Dilaudid). The narcotic antagonists
nalorphine, naloxone, levallophan, and cyclazocine blocked the teratogenic
effects of both single and multiple doses of the narcotics.

Ionic requirements of proximal tubular sodium transport. II. Hydrogen ion.

Green R, Giebisch G.

Simultaneous perfusion to proximal convoluted tubules and peritubular capillaries
was used to study the effects of different perfusion fluids on sodium
reabsorption and hydrogen secretion, which was calculated as bicarbonate
reabsorption and titratable acid. Results show that sodium reabsorption was not
tightly coupled to hydrogen secretion. Bicarbonate stimulates both sodium
reabsorption and hydrogen secretion, but Tris stimulates only sodium
reabsorption. Imposing an adverse chloride gradient across the proximal tubule
(C1- peritubular greater than C1- luminal) decreased sodium reabsorption but did 
not diminish hydrogen secretion. Diamox inhibited both net sodium and hydrogen
transport. It is concluded that there is not firm linkage between sodium
reabsorption and hydrogen secretion and that bicarbonate probably stimulates
sodium transport by a number of mechanisms, including an effect on the sodium
transport unrelated to its ability to increase hydrogen ion secretion.

ECS, intracellular pH, and electrolytes of cardiac and skeletal muscle.

Poole-Wilson PA, Cameron IR.

The extracellular space (ECS) of muscle from each ventricle of the heart (RV and 
LV), the atria, diaphragm, and quadriceps was estimated in the anesthetized
rabbit from the distribution volumes of [14C]insulin, [14C]sucrose, [51Cr]EDTA,
and C1--. Whole-tissue electrolytes were measured and intracellular electrolytes 
calculated. The ECS of the tissues varied, increasing in the order quadriceps
less than LV less than RV less than atria. The volume of distribution of
[14C]inulin was always less than that of either [14C]sucrose or [51Cr]EDTA which 
agreed closely, whereas that of C1-- was always greater. There was no difference 
in intracellular K+ in muscle from each of the cardiac chambers, whereas
intracellular Na+ and C1-- varied, increasing in the order quadriceps less than
LV less than RV less than atria. Intracellular pH, measured with [14C]DMO did not
differ in any of the tissues studied. It is concluded that, in vivo, the
estimated ECS incardiac muscle is lower than that reported in vitro, that
[51Cr]EDTA is a satisfactory ECS marker, and that differences in intracellular
Na+ and C1-- but not K+ or pH exist between muscle from the cardiac chambers.

Intracellular pH and K+ of cardiac and skeletal muscle in acidosis and alkalosis.

Poole-Wilson PA, Cameron IR.

The effects of a metabolic and respiratory acidosis and alkalosis on
intracellular pH (pHi) and K+ have been compared in cardiac and skeletal muscle
from the anesthetized rabbit. The extracellular space and pHi were calculated
from the distribution volumes of [51Cr] EDTA and [14C]DMO, respectively. When pHe
was varied by altering PCO2, the slope of the line relating pHi to the
extracellular pH (pHe) was greater (P less than 0.05--0.001) than that obtained
during metabolic changes of pHe in right and left ventricles, atria, diaphragm,
and quadriceps. During metabolic acidosis and alkalosis, the slope of pHi/pHe
line did not vary between tissues. During respiratory acidosis, there was no
difference in slope between cardiac tissues, but it was less in left ventricle
than quadriceps (P less than 0.001). In left ventricle intracellular K+ increased
in a metabolic (P less than 0.05) or respiratory acidosis (P less than 0.02),
whereas in diaphragm it decreased (P less than 0.02). Intracellular K+ correlated
with pHe and pHE-PHi. Changes in pHi but not intracellular K+ could explain known
differences in myocardial function in respiratory and metabolic acidosis.

Effects of autonomic neurohumors on transmembrane potentials of atrial plateau
fibers.

Davis LD.

Isolated canine atrial plateau fibers were treated with acetylcholine or
norepinephrine to note the effects on the transmembrane potential. Acetylcholine,
1.0 or 2.0 mug/ml, consistently reduced the slope of inherent phase 4
depolarization. Increases in maximum diastolic potential and rising velocity
occurred along with a decrease in overshoot. The plateau phase disappeared.
Pretreatment with atropine, 1.0 mug/ml, prevented these responses, and alone this
drug had no discernible effect. Norepinephrine consistently increased the slope
of phase 4 depolarization. Frequently plateau fibers generated action potentials 
by the normal pacemaker mechanism. "Arrhythmias" characterized by spontaneous
excitations were induced in 92% of the norepinephrine experiments. Norepinephrine
also enhanced the plateau phase of the action potential and decreased the rising 
velocity and overshoot. Racemic propranolol, 1.0 mug/ml, blocked all the above
effects including arrhythmias. Dextropropranolol, 1.0 mug/ml, did not block
effects produced by norepinephrine. Acetylcholine, applied to fibers under
treatment with norepinephrine, reduced the slope of norepinephrine-induced phase 
4 depolarization and terminated induced arrhythmias.

Interstitial fluid pressure and alkaline gastric secretion.

Altamirano M, Requena, Pérez TC.

The interstitial fluid pressure of the submucosa of the gastric fundus was
monitored by means of Guyton's capsules in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital. 
The intracapsular pressure (ICP) was measured during secretion produced by: a)
hypertonic solutions placed inside the stomach; b) arterial hypertension (200
mmHg) applied during intra-arterial infusion of histamine, and c) intra-arterial 
infusion of acetylcholine. The first procedure did not modify the ICP. On the
other hand, whenever interstitial fluid appeared in the gastric lumen during
hypertension plus histamine, the mean ICP increased, mostly due to augmented
capillary filtration. The hydraulic coefficient measured in these experiments was
at least 4 orders of magnitude larger than the respective osmotic coefficient.
The action of acetylcholine was complex: large doses enlarged the net capillary
filtration, but small doses increased the mean ICP by muscle stimulation only.
Contraction of the muscularis mucosae might be the most important mechanism
underlying bulk flow of interstitial fluid in physiological conditions. It is
concluded that hydraulic gradients across the epithelium might account for the
"secretion" of "alkaline" juice.

Overview: maintenance therapy in psychiatry: I. Schizophrenia.

Davis JM.

Hospital psychiatry has evolved from long-term "treatment" programs that were
primarily custodial to the successful pharmacological treatment of acute
psychotic episodes. Unfortunately, many patients still return to the hospital
with relapses. This so-called revolving door syndrome draws attention to the
critical importance of preventing as well as treating acute episodes. In the
first part of this overview, the author reviews the clinical literature on
prophylactic treatment of schizophrenia with maintenance antipsychotic drugs. The
second part will review the literature on prophylactic treatment of affective
disorders with lithium and tricyclics. In the opinion of the author these drugs
provide the potential for truly preventive psychiatry.

Inpatient and outpatient patterns of psychotropic drug prescribing by
nonpsychiatrist physicians.

Raft D, Davidson J, Toomey TC, Spencer RF, Lewis BF.

The authors found that among 228 general hospital patients, minor tranquilizers
were prescribed most often and with the least justification and that major
tranquilizers were prescribed sparingly and by and large judiciously.
Antidepressants were given less often than would be justified by the incidence of
depressive illness among these patients. Nonrecognition of depression in patients
with somatic complaints and autonomic signs of depression contributed to this
lack of treatment.

Protective effect of hypothermia in cerebral oxygen deficiency caused by arterial
hypoxia.

Carlsson C, Hägerdal M, Siesjö BK.

To study the cerebral protective effects of hypothermia in arterial hypoxia,
anesthetized (70% N2O), mechanically ventilated rats were cooled to a body
temperature of 27 C. Hypoxia was induced by decreasing the oxygen content in the 
inspired gas mixture either to 6-7 per cent or to 2.5-3 per cent. This reduced
mean PaO2 to about 25 and 11-12 torr, respectively. At PaO2 torr, there was no
change in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebrla oxygen consumption (CMRO2), or
labile tissue metabolites. The absence of signs of cerebral hypoxia could be
attributed to an effect of temperature and pH on the hemoglobin-oxygen
dissociation curve. Thus, at 27 C with a PaO2 of 25 torr the total oxygen content
(TO2) of arterial blood remained greater than 15 ml (100 ml)-1, about three times
the value obtained at this PO2 in normothermic rats. At PaO2 11-12 torr, arterial
TO2 was reduced to about 5 ml (100 ml) (-1). The hypoxia induced no change in
CMRO2, a threefold increase in CBF, a moderate lactacidosis in the tissue, and a 
small decrease in phosphocreatine content, but no change in ATP, ADP, or AMP.
These changes are less marked than those occurring at the same arterial TO2 in
normothermic rats. It is concluded that hypothermia exerts a pronounced
protective effect on the brain in hypoxic hypoxia, and that two mechanisms are
involved. First, since hypothermia shifts the oxyhemoglobin-dissociation curve
towards the left, and prevents or minimizes a rightward shift due to acidosis, it
maintains a high TO2 in arterial blood at a given PaO2. Second, by reducing
CMRO2, and thereby presumably also cellular energy requirements, hypothermia
exerts a protective effect at the cellular level.

Characterization of a caprine herpesvirus.

Berrios PE, McKercher DG.

A virus, which was isolated from kids (Capra hircus) affected with a relatively
severe generalized infection, was found to contain DNA and to have a buoyant
density of 1.2820 g/cm3. The virus was sensitive to the action of lipid solvents 
and trypsin and was rapidly inactivated at pH 3.0 and at temperatures of 50 and
56 C. The virion, an icosahedron consisting of a nucleoid surrounded by a double 
membrane, measured approximately 135 nm in diameter. On the basis of its chemical
and physical properties, the virus is considered a herpesvirus.

Transfer of drugs across the ruminal wall in goats.

Jenkins WL, Davis LE, Boulos BM.

The rates at which pentobarbital, salicylate, antipyrine, and quinine were
transferred from the rumen of intact, conscious goats were measured. The rates at
which the same drugs diffused from the blood plasma (under conditions of constant
drug concentration) into the ruminal solution were also evaluated. These
compounds were absorbed by simple diffusion, and the rates of transfer were a
function of pH of the intraruminal solution. The diffusion of drugs from plasma
into the reticulorumen allowed steady-state distributions to be established in
some goats. The theoretical and observed steady-state distributions were
compared. There were good correlations for pentobarbital and antipyrine, but not 
for salicylate and quinine. These findings confirm in vivo the general principles
of drug transfer across ruminal epithelium that were derived from previous
studies conducted in vitro.

Preservation of hypoxic pulmonary pressor response in canine pneumococcal
pneumonia.

Hiser W, Penman RW, Reeves JT.

To determine the role of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in pneumococcal
pneumonia, hemodynamic measurements were made in 16 dogs before, and within 36
hours after, intrapulmonary administration of type III pneumococcus. Ten dogs
with one lobe or more of pneumonia increased their pulmonary vascular resistances
and slightly decreased their arterial O2 tensions. Hypoxia increased and
hyperoxia decreased their pulmonary vascular resistances. During O2 breathing,
arterial PO2 was less during than before the pneumonia and increased when
pulmonary perfusion was diverted away from the diseased lung. In 2 dogs breathing
air, forcing the cardiac output through the diseased lung caused an increase in
vascular resistance that could clearly be reduced by O2 breathing. In 5 dogs,
lung mast cell counts showed no decrease in the lobes with pneumonia. In
pneumococcal pneumonia, the hypoxic pulmonary pressor mechanism serves to
decrease blood flow to the diseased lobes and, thus, to maintain the arterial
PO2. Lung mast cells could participate in this response.

Value of capillary blood gas analyses in the management of acute respiratory
distress.

Begin R, Racine T, Roy JC.

A comparative study of blood gases and acid-base parameters, obtained
simultaneously from arterial and finger capillary samples, was performed in 45
patients in acute respiratory distress without circulatory shock. Although small 
and significant differences were found between the 2 sample pH, Po2, Pco2, and
bicarbonate values, the correlations between the 2 were greater than or equal to 
0.97 for each variable. It was concluded that although the arterial blood is the 
preferred sample for evaluation of blood gases and acid-base status of patients
in acute respiratory distress, capillary blood appears to be a valid substitute
in the management of these patients. This technique is particularly valuable in
pediatric practice, where repeated arterial samples are less easily obtained.

Bone marrow transplantation in man.

Cline MJ, Gale RP, Stiehm ER, Opelz G, Young LS, Feig SA, Fahey JL.

Bone marrow transplantation is emerging as a viable therapeutic approach to a
number of diseases that are usually or uniformly fatal. We review here recent
experiences in bone marrow transplantation in man at UCLA and in various other
institutions throughout the world. We examine marrow transplantation in
immunodeficiency diseases, acute leukemia, and aplastic anemia and consider the
problems of infection in the transplant recipients. The applications of tissue
typing to marrow transplantation and immunologic manipulations, which may
influence engraftment and graft-versus-host disease, are also reported.

The virus hypothesis in systemic lupus erythematosus.

Phillips PE.

Type-C viruses are currently the prime etiologic candidates in systemic lupus
erythematosus. On the basis of knowledge gained from studies of experimental and 
human models of chronic viral disease, there are possible pathogenetic roles of a
virus in systemic lupus erythematosus. Experimental attempts at implicating
specific viruses have been predominantly negative, but evidence for enhanced
type-C-virus expression has recently been reported.

The membrane transport of ascorbic acid.

Mann GV, Newton P.

A system for measuring the rate of transport of dehydroascorbate into human red
blood cells shows Michaelis-Menten type kinetics with substrate inhibition at
levels above 150 muM DHA. The addition of sugars impairs this transport in the
diminishing hierarchy D-glucose, D-mannose, D-xylose, D-galactose, L-lyxose,
D-araboascorbate, L-sorbose and 2-deoxy-D-ribose. The effect of glucose on
transport of ascorbate is marked at physiological levels. Transport of DHA is
accelerated by copper ion and allows dehydroascorbate to move against a
concentration gradient. The evidence supports the hypotheses proposing that
hyperglycemia will impair the intracellular availability of vitamin C.

Carcinofetal alterations in glucosamine-6-phosphate synthetase.

Tsuiki S, Miyagi T.

The levels of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthetase in various rat tissues including
those undergoing differentiation or regeneration revealed that the enzyme is
related to tissue proliferation and differentiation. In the liver upon neoplastic
transformation, the level of glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase rises and the
liver form of the enzyme having a pI at 5.0 is replaced by a form with a pI of
4.1. Since the latter form has also been found present in whole embryos (12- and 
14-day) and brain, the molecular alterations of glucosamine-6-phosphate
synthetase in liver neoplasia can be considered to be carcinofetal.

A hepatoma-associated alkaline phosphatase, the Kasahara isozyme, compared with
one of the isozymes of FL amnion cells.

Higashino K, Kudo S, Otani R, Yamamura Y.

It was found that a human hepatoma-associated ALP (orthophosphoric monoester
phosphohydrolase, E.C. 3.1.3.1) shared electrophoretic mobility, inactivation by 
urea, inhibition by inorganic phosphate, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and amino
acids (L-phenylalanine, L-leucine and L-homoarginine), heat stability,
sensitivity to neuraminidase, pH optimum, Km value, and antigen site with fast
moving ALP isozymes of FL cell strain derived from human amniotic membrane.
However, 40-week-old fresh amniotic membrane lacked this isozyme. Instead, it had
a placental type ALP consisting of minor components. The other ALP isozyme of FL 
cells had properties common to hepatoma ALP with regard to L-phenylalanine
sensitivity, inhibition by ethylenediaminetetraacetate, inactivation by urea, and
antigen site, but differed from it in electrophoretic mobility, sensitivity to
L-leucine and L-homoarginine, and the presence of another antigen site. It was
more heat stable and more sensitive to inhibition by inorganic phosphate than
Hepatoma AP. The possible regulatory mechanism between the hepatoma-type ALP and 
the placental type ALP in the amnion cells is considered.

Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. A sensitive indicator of renal ischaemic injury in
experimental animals and renal homograft rejection in man.

Ward JP.

The sites of ischaemic injury within the kidney are reviewed and the diagnostic
value of measurements of plasma and urinary enzymes in renal ischaemic injury and
in renal homotransplant rejection in experimental animals and man is examined.
Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) is an enzyme primarily located in the
brush border of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney. Its unique
localization in the cells most easily damaged by ischaemia and its ease of assay 
provide the rationale for its use in the measurement and diagnosis of renal
ischaemic injury. gamma-GT activity was measured in dogs undergoing varying
periods of renal ischaemia and under conditions of local renal hypothermia and
was shown to be a sensitive indicator of ischaemic injury. Twenty consecutive
patients undergoing renal homotransplantation were studied by daily estimation of
their 24-h urinary gamma-GT activity; excellent correlation was obtained between 
raised levels of this enzyme and the clinical diagnosis of transplant rejection.

Influence of pH on the heat inactivation of staphylococcal enterotoxin A as
determined by monkey feeding and serological assay.

Humber JY, Denny CB, Bohrer CW.

The effect of pH on the thermal inactivation of staphylococcal enterotoxin A was 
investigated. Analysis of heated toxin by immunodiffusion in gel indicated that
enterotoxin A in beef bouillon was inactivated faster at pH 5.3 than at pH 6.2.
The z values (slopes) for the heat inactivation curves at pH 6.2 and 5.3 were
49.5 and 55 F (about 27 and 30 C), respectively. Enterotoxin produced and heated 
in dialyzed Casamino Acids medium and assayed by monkey feeding was more easily
inactivated by heat at pH 5.3 than at pH 7.8. Thermal inactivation curves for
enterotoxin A in beef bouillon (5 mug/ml, pH 5.3) were determined by two methods,
monkey feeding and serological assay. The z values for the curves obtained by
these two methods were both 55 F, although loss of biological or toxic activity
of the enterotoxin occurred before loss of serological activity.

Survival of salmonellae during pepperoni manufacture.

Smith JL, Huhtanen CN, Kissinger JC, Palumbo SA.

Survival of salmonellae in artificially contaminated beef-pork mixtures
(approximately 10(4) salmonellae/g) was studied in pepperoni prepared by either a
natural flora or lactic starter culture fermentation or in nonfermented sausages.
The pepperoni did not become salmonellae free during the usual commercial 15 to
30-day drying period. Salmonella dublin was present in all products, fermented or
unfermented, after 42 to 43 days of drying. At a lower level of contamination,
10(3)/g, S. dublin could not be recovered from starter culture-fermented
pepperoni after 14 days of drying but persisted in the natural flora-fermented
sausage. S. typhimurium (initial count, 10(4)/g) was absent after 42 days of
drying when starter culture was used to ferment the pepperoni, but was still
present in the natural flora-fermented and unfermented products. S. dublin, host 
adapted to cattle, or S. choleraesuis, host adapted to swine, had similar
survival patterns in beef pork, or beef-pork pepperoni. Heating salmonellae
contaminated beef-pork pepperoni (after fermantation but before drying) to an
internal temperature of 60 C (trichinae inactivating) eliminated the food-borne
pathogen from the sausage product.

Growth of Staphylococcus and Salmonella on frankfurters with and without sodium
nitrite.

Bayne HG, Michener HD.

Conventional and nitrite-free frankfurters in loosely wrapped packages were
compared as to their ability to support growth of Salmonella, Staphylococcus, and
their naturally occurring spoilage flora at 7 C (simulating refrigerated storage)
and 20 C (simulating possible temperature abuse). At 7 C Salmonella did not grow 
in either type of frankfurter; Staphylococcus and the natural spoilage flora
sometimes grew more rapidly in the absence of nitrite, but the difference was not
significant. At 20 C growth of Salmonella, Staphylococcus, and of the spoilage
flora was, at most, only slightly faster on nitrite-free frankfurters. Salmonella
was not suppressed in broth culture experiments the pH and nitrite content found 
in frankfurters. Although either type of frankfurter can become hazardous due to 
growth of Salmonella or Staphylococcus, no unusual or additional hazard resulted 
from the omission of nitrite from frankfurters.

Characterization of an extracellular dextranase from Fusarium moniliforme.

Simonson LG, Liberta AE, Richardson A.

An extracellular dextranase (EC 3.2.1.11) was purified approximately 75-fold from
cell-free culture filtrates of Fusarium moniliforme. The purified dextranase was 
of the endo type, and isomaltose was identified as the primary end product of
dextran hydrolysis. The molecular weight of the dextranase was determined to be
39,000 by gel permeation chromatography. The enzyme was most active at pH 5.5,
and the temperature optimum was near 55 C. Activity was not inhibited by either
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or iodoacetate. The Km for dextran with an
average molecular weight of 10,000 was estimated to be 1.1 X 10(-4) M. The
electrophoretic mobility of the dextranase was distinctly different from that of 
a Penicillium-derived commercial dextranase. The F. moniliforme dextranase was
also found to differ from the commercial preparation by its greater relative
activity against glucans isolated from Streptococcus mutans.

Graft versus host reaction. An ultrastructural study.

De Dobbeleer GD, Ledoux-Corbusier MH, Achten GA.

Graft versus host reaction (GvH) following leukocytic transfusions occurred in a 
34-year-old man with a generalized lymphosarcoma. Histologic and ultrastructural 
studies were performed, with special reference to dyskeratotic cells scattered in
the epidermis. These cells are usually considered to be a constant and important 
feature of GvH reaction. Dense aggregation of tonofilaments, including
cytoplasmic organelles and loss of desmosomes, were seen in dyskeratotic cells.
Several intracellular desmosomes with tonofilaments bound to their attachment
plaque were observed. Some of these cells were able to reach the horny layer;
some others were phagocytosed by neighboring keratinocytes. These cells could be 
the result of a toxic damage to the epidermis, provoked by the immunologic
phenomenon implicated in GvH reaction. Later in the clinical course, bullae
formations occurred, showing some features of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN),
as well as features of GvH reaction.

Nephrotic syndrome in indian children.

Srivastava RN, Mayekar G, Anand R, Choudhry VP, Ghai OP, Tandon HD.

A clinicopathological study of 206 Indian children with nephrotic syndrome showed
a primary renal cause in 195 (96%), of which 77% were boys. In 126 children (96
boys, 30 girls) onset of the disorder occurred before the age of 5 years. Renal
biopsy showed minimal lesions in 150 patients (77%); in 85 of these biopsy was
done 3 months to 16 years after onset of the nephrotic syndrome. Significant
renal histological abnormalities in 45 cases were labelled as mesangiocapillary
8, mesangioproliferative 4, proliferative with extensive crescents 2, membranous 
3, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 9, focal global glomerulosclerosis 2,
advanced nonspecific 8, and mild proliferative 9. Nephritic manifestations were
mainly associated with significant renal lesions, which were more frequently
encountered when the onset of disease was after the age of 5 years. Clearance of 
proteinuria with corticosteroid therapy was practically confined to patients with
minimal or mild renal histological changes. Our findings suggest that the pattern
of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in Indian children is similar to that reported
from Western countries.

Separation of deoxyribonucleases (DNases) of normal human stratum corneum and

Förster FJ, Leonhardi G, Zöllner EJ, Zahn RK.

Normal stratum corneum and psoriatic scales were homogenized and a differential
centrifugation was performed. The DNase activity of the individual fractions was 
investigated by micro-dis-electrophoresis. At pH 5 only in the 600xg pellet and
105.000xg supernatant of normal keratin DNase activity could be observed.
However, all psoriatic fractions showed distinct enzyme activities. At pH 7.4
little psoriatic DNase activity could only be demonstrated in the 105.000xg
supernatant. Except from the 15.000xg pellet all fractions of normal stratum
corneum displayed marked activities. In addition the 105.000xg supernatant showed
two different DNase bands.

The subcellular distribution of phosphatases, proteinases, and ribonucleases of
normal human stratum corneum and psoriatic scales was determined after
differential centrifugation. All psoriatic enzymes showed much increased
activities as compared to the normal stratum corneum enzymes. The highest
activities of alkaline phosphatase from psoriatic scales could be detected in the
nuclear fraction. The main activities of all other tested phosphatases and
proteinases were present in the cytoplasmatic fraction. The subcellular
distribution of the ribonucleases varied according to the pH value.

A reinvestigation of the sites of transcription and translation of Euglena
chloroplastic phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase.

Lesiewicz JL, Herson DS.

An attempt was made to determine the sites of chloroplast phenylalanyl-tRNA
synthetase transcription and translation. Inhibitors of bacterial RNA and protein
synthesis were added to logarithmic and stationary phase cultures of Euglena
gracilis wild-type B. Logarithmic phase cultures were sensitive to both types of 
inhibitors. In stationary phase cultures plastid synthetase was reduced by RNA
but not by protein synthesis inhibitors. The effect of the antibiotics on the
mitochondrial enzyme was also noted. Several possible explanations of these
resuults are discussed.

[Article in German]

Nichelmann M, Martin R, Scholz J, Lyhs L.

Rectal temperature, respiratory rate, arterial and venous pH and arterial and
venous pCO2 were recorded at intervals of 15-30 minutes in female broiler rabbits
exposed an environmental temperature of 35 degrees C, until they died.
Respiratory rate and blood pH rose, and pCO2 fell, until a rectal temperature of 
42 degrees C was reached. Upon further increase in rectal temperature the
respiratory rate and pH began to fall, while pCO2 began to rise. The rabbits died
when rectal temperature reached 43 degrees C. Features of respiratory function
peculiar to the rabbit were discussed.

Outpatient phenothiazine use and bone marrow depression. A report from the drug
epidemiology unit and the Boston collaborative drug surveillance program.

Swett C Jr.

Phenothiazine-induced bone marrow depression (BMD) was evaluated in three
separate but complementary data bases: (1) Among 1,048 patients admitted to
psychiatric hospitals, there was no evidence of subclinical depression of the
white blood cell (WBC) count attributable to phenothiazines used before
admission. (2) Among 18,587 medical inpatients, there were 34 patients admitted
for BMD in the absence of neoplasia or prior cytotoxic drug therapy; one of the
latter reported using chlorpromazine hydrochloride, but it is doubtful whether
this drug was the cause of the BMD. (3) Among 24,795 medical, surgical, and
gynecological patients surveyed over a ten-month period in 1972, there were four 
who were admitted for BMD; one of the latter had a reversible leukopenia
attributed to trifluoperazine hydrochloride.

[Tumour hyperacidulation through intravenous glucose infusion enhanced by
amygdalin and beta-glucosidase application (author's transl)].

[Article in German]

Ardenne M, Reitnauer PG.

Tumour peracidity in otherwise moderately hyperacidulated tumours or tumour
regions of DS carcinosarcoma-bearing Wistar rats attained by glucose infusion was
substantially increased by simultaneous infusion of amygdalin and intratumoral
i.m. or i.v. application of beta-glucosidase. Here the pH value of healthy
tissue, measured at the sceletal muscle, remained unchanged. By means of the said
process, tumour hyperacidulation has been raised to a level of deltapH =0.97;
attaining a pH difference between tumourous and normal tissue of up to deltapH = 
1.6. In one case, the slope of pH reduction in the tumour increased to 870%.
Moreover, combined administration of glucose, amygdalin and beta-glucosidase
evoked a significant cancerostatic effect hypogenesis, tumour regression) being
comparable with the action of an Ifosfamid dosage of 150 mg-kg-1. However, i.m.
and i.v. application of beta-glucosidase under narcosis results in an overall
process that still remains somewhat too toxic. Hence optimizing studies are
intended with the particular aim to further improve the comparability of this
process.

Studies of the pain produced by mafenide acetate preparations in burns.

Harrison HN, Shuck JM, Caldwell E.

In a double-blind triple cross-over clinical study, 37 patients were exposed to
several formulations of mafenide acetate (Sulfamylon Cream) and their pain
responses were recorded and converted to a semiquantitative pain index. The 11.2%
concentration in cream was two to three times more painful than the 5%
concentration. Hypertonicity and not the pH level appears to be the cause of the 
pain produced by the high (11.2%) concentration. The tonicity of the cream
carrier and 11.2% mafenide acetate are 1,080 mOsm/kg and 1,100 mOsm/kg,
respectively, for a total of 2,180 mOsm/kg. The carrier cream without glycerol
and a 5% concentration of mafenide cream were much less painful than the 11.2%
concentration of mafenide. Both afforded a great deal of relief to the patients
who received the medications.

Microbiol growth in lipid emulsions used in parenteral nutrition.

Melly MA, Meng HC, Schaffner W.

Parenteral nutrition via central venous catheterization is associated with
serious risks, especially that of sepsis. Lipid emulsion (Intralipid[Sweden]),
which may be administered peripherally, was evaluated for its potential to
support microbial growth. Washed cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Candida
albicans, and three species of Gram-negative rods were all capable of multiplying
in the emulsion at room temperature. Variations in inoculum size did not affect
the growth rate. Studies comparing the emulsion to amino acid-glucose solutions
(total parenteral nutrition [TPN])confirmed other reports that TPN inhibits the
growth of certain bacteria but merely retards fungal multiplication. When human
serum was added to the lipid emulsion in an attempt to simulate in vivo
conditions at the catheter tip, Escherichia coli was inhibited while the growth
of S aureus and C albicians was unaltered.

Propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene tissue concentrations in fatalities associated
with propoxyphene hydrochloride and propoxyphene napsylate.

Baselt RC, Wright JA.

Propoxyphene and its major metabolite norpropoxyphene have been determined in
blood and liver in 29 cases of death in which propoxyphene, either as the
hydrochloride or as the napsylate salt, was involved. The use of propoxyphene
napsylate (Darvon-N) contributed to the deaths of 4 persons, 3 of whom were
former heroin addicts receiving large amounts of this drug in connection with
propoxyphene substitution programs. In the majority of cases the norpropoxyphene 
blood concentrations exceed the propoxyphene concentrations, although brain
determinations in several instances indicate that norpropoxyphene does not cross 
the blood-brain barrier with the same ease as propoxyphene. On the basis of the
comparative toxicities of propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene in animals and the
high tissue concentrations of norporpoxyphene in man after propoxyphene
administration, it is conceivable that norpropoxyphene contributes to the toxic
effects of propoxyphene.

[Morphological manifestations and morphogenesis of the graft vs. host reaction in
the brain of F1 hybrids following the administration of parental lymphoid cells
and its effect on tumor inoculation].

[Article in Russian]

Zarudin VV, Shcherbakov VIa.

It was established that intracerebral introduction of 10 min parental cells of
the spleen brought about in hybrids (CBAXC57Bl/6) F1 infiltrative-destructive
changes (development of lymphocytic infiltrations, dystrophy in the nerve cells, 
myelin fibres and neurogliacytes) the intensity of which was found to be
considerably higher in cases of injection of parental spleen cells from
specifically sensitized donors. Spleen cells of mice CBA produced much greater
changes as compared with those produced by spleen cells of mice C57Bl/6.
Inoculation into the mice brain of 10 mln of spleen cells together with tumour in
a dose of 1500 cells produced a clear cut inhibitory effect on the tumour growth,
this effect being more pronounced following introduction of sensitized cells of
the spleen of mice CBA.

Metachromatic leukodystrophy. Ultrastructural and enzymatic study of a case of
variant O form.

Raynaud EJ, Escourolle R, Baumann N, Turpin JC, Dubois G, Malpuech G, Lagarde R.

A variant of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), Austin disease, is characterized
by a multiple isozyme deficiency of arylsulfatase. A 3 1/2-year-old girl with
progressive mental and physical deterioration had decreased activities of
arylsulfatases A and B in the leukocytes, shown by acylamide gel electrophoresis.
Under the electron microscope, biopsy specimens of the brain and the peripheral
nerve showed lamellar structures with socalled zebra bodies in the cytoplasmic
processes of glial cells, granulo-membranous inclusions with fingerprint
configurations in neurons, and myelinlike material in Schwann cells. Results from
our study suggest an intricate nature of this dysmetabolic disorder, which shows 
ultrastructural changes usually seen in classic MLD, a deficiency of
arylsulfatase A only, concomitant with those seen in mucopolysaccharidoses such
as Hurler and Sanfilippo syndromes.

Changes in the acid base status of sheep anaesthetised with a combination of
atropine sulphate acepromazine and ketamine hydrochloride.

Thurmon JC, Kumar A, Cawley AJ.

pH, PaCO2, PaO2, standard bicarbonate, base excess and reduced pH were measured
in sheep before and at regular intervals after administration of ketamine with
and without atropine and acepromazine premedication. A decrease in pH and PaO2
and a rise in PaCO2 was observed 15 minutes after administration of ketamine.
Administration of atropine with and without acepromazine had no significant
effect on pH, PaCO2 and PaO2. The values for standard bicarbonate, base excess
and reduced pH were not significantly affected. This indicates that minor changes
observed in pH, PaCO2 after ketamine administration are compensated for by the
healthy animal's blood buffer system.

Influence of some physical factors on survival of Marek's disease vaccine virus.

Colwell WM, Simmons DG, Harris JR, Fulp TG, Carrozza JH, Maag TA.

Cell-associated Marek's disease (MD) vaccine was suspended at dilutions normally 
used for vaccination in seven commercially available diluents and in tryptose
phosphate broth. The stability of diluted vaccines was determined by assay in
cell cultures subjected to 0 to 37 C for 0 to 90 minutes. Optimum holding
temperatures for MD vaccine virus survival varied with the specific diluents
employed. Some diluents afforded greatest survival when dilution was at 0 C and
held at 0 C, while others performed best when dilution was at 25 C followed by
cooling and holding at 0 C. Diluents which allowed greatest survival when tested 
at 37 C also performed well under other temperature regimes. Spectinomycin
dihydrochloride pentahydrate and various buffering compounds were added to
commercial diluents used for diluting MD vaccine. Additives producing osmolality 
of 745 mOsm/kg and higher markedly reduced vaccine virus survival. The adverse
effects of high osmotic pressure were accentuated by extended holding time,
elevated incubation temperature, and physical manipulations including mechanical 
mixing or expressing through a syringe and needle. Satisfactory MD vaccine virus 
survival was afforded by a commercial diluent especially formulated to
accommodate the pH osmolality changes produced by adding spectinomycin
dihydrochloride pentahydrate.

Molecular nature of beta-galactosidase from different tissues in two strains of
the house mouse.

Seyedyazdani R, Floderus Y, Lundin LG.

One inbred mouse strain, C57BL/Kl, has high galactosidase activities in all
tissues while another strain, DBA/2/Kl, has low activities determined by the Bgs 
locus. Beta-Galactosidase from these two strains was partly purified by a
five-step procedure: acidification, ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel
filtration at two pHs, and isoelectric focusing. No qualitative differences were 
found between the enzyme preparations from the two strains. They had identical
heat inactivation curves, pH optima, molecular weight, and isoelectric points,
and the Km values were very similar. It thus seems that this genetic difference
in enzyme activity probably cannot be explained by a variation of the
galactosidase-specific activity but rather reflects a difference in number of
enzyme molecules. Eight different isoenzymes were separated from liver, kidney,
and spleen. Each isoenzyme has a different electrophoretic mobility and there is 
a stepwise increase in molecular weight from 143,000 to 380,000 beginning with
the protein having the lowest isoelectric point. A likely interpretation is that 
the isoenzymes bind a smaller polypeptide in varying numbers in addition to the
enzymatic polypeptide per se.

The effects of acute and chronic nicotine hydrogen (+)-tartrate administration
and subsequent withdrawal on rat liver tryptophan pyrrolase activity and their
comparison with those of morphine, phenobarbitone and ethanol.

Badawy AA, Evans M.

Acute administration of nicotine hydrogen (+)-tartrate enhances the activity of
rat liver tryptophan pyrrolase by a hormonal mechanism. Chronic nicotine
treatment inhibits, and subsequent withdrawal enhances, the pyrrolase activity.
The inhibition during chronic treatment is not due to a defective apoenzyme
synthesis nor a decreased cofactor availability. Regeneration of liver NADP+ in
vitro and in vivo reverses the inhibition. Chronic nicotine administration
increases the liver NADPH concentration. The above effects of nicotine resemble
to a remarkable degree those previously shown for morphine, phenobarbitone and
ethanol. All effects are compared, and their possible significance in relation to
drug dependence is discussed.

Plastid development in primary leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris. Development of
plastid adenosine triphosphatase activity during greening.

Gregory P, Bradbeer JW.

The etioplasts of dark-grown bean leaves showed ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase)
activity which had a pH optimum of 8.5, was stimulated by dithiothreitol and
unaffected by light-triggering. Bean chloroplasts showed a low activity of
dark-induced ATPase with a pH optimum of 8.5 and a substantial amount of
light-triggered activity with a pH optimum of 8.0. The light-triggered activity
depended on dithiothreitol and Mg2+ and was promoted by phenazine methosulphate. 
Light-triggered ATPase activity was completely inhibited by
20mum-dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide. Etioplasts developed light-triggered ATPase
activity in response to 30 min illumination of the etiolated leaves. During the
48 h of light-induced greening of dark-grown leaves there was a 70% increase of
the chloroplast ATPase activity found after light-triggering and a 30% fall in
the dark-induced activity, both expressed on a per leaf basis. As the larger part
of these changes occurred during the first 30 min of illumination, it is
concluded that most or all of the chloroplast ATPase was present in the
etioplast, a conclusion identical with that of Lockshin et al. (1971) for maize. 
During 48 h of greening there was a tenfold increase in the amount of thylakoid
membrane in the leaf together with an 83% fall in the ATPase activity per m2 of
thylakoid membrane, measured after light-triggering.

Tricarboxylic acid-cycle and related enzymes in restricted facultative
methylotrophs.

Colby J, Zatman LJ.

The isolation is described of pure cultures of three non-methane-utilizing
methylotrophic bacteria which, together with the previously described Bacillus
PM6, have a very limited range of growth substrates; these organisms are
designated "restricted facultative' methylotrophs. Two of these isolates, W6A and
W3A1, grow only on glucose out of 50 non-C1 compounds tested, whereas the third
isolate S2A1 and Bacillus PM6 grow on betaine, glucose, gluconate, alanine,
glutamate, citrate and nutrient agar, but not on any of a further 56 non-C1
compounds. Crude sonic extracts of trimethylamine-grown and glucose-grown W6A and
W3A1 isolates, and of trimethylamine-grown C2A1 (an obligate methylotroph)
contain (i) no detectable 2-oxogltarate dehydrogenase activity, (ii) very low or 
zero specific activities of succinate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA synthetase
and (iii) NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. Extracts of
trimethylamine-grown PM6 and S2A1 methylotrophs have (i) very low 2-oxoglutarate 
dehydrogenase specific activities, (ii) comparatively high specific activities of
succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA synthetase and
(iii) NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity but no NAD+-dependent
isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. The activities of most of these enzymes are
increased during growth on glucose, alanine, glutamate or citrate, but only very 
low 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activities are present under all growth
conditions. The restricted facultative methylotrophs grow on certain non-C1
compounds in the absence of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and, in some cases, of
other enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle; these lesions cannot therefore be 
the sole cause of obligate methylotrophy.

Desaturation of stearic acid by liver and adipose tissue from
obese-hyperglycaemic mice (ob/ob).

Enser M.

Stearic acid desaturase activity was assayed in preparations from perigenital
adipose tissue and liver from lean and genetically obese female mice (ob/ob). The
total activity in the perigenital adipose tissue from obese mice was threefold
greater than in the tissue from lean mice, but per g of adipose tissue the
activity was twofold greater in tissue from lean mice. In liver, the activity in 
obese mice was elevated at 8 weeks of age, remained elevated up to 24 weeks and
then decreased by half at 48 weeks, but at all ages was higher than that in lean 
mice. The decrease in desaturase activity of liver from obese mice at 48 weeks
corresponded to a change in the fatty acid composition of liver lipids toward
that found in lean mice. Whereas in adipose tissue much of the increased enzyme
activity may be due to tissue hyperplasia, in liver it is mainly an increased
activity per cell.

The stimulation by synaptic transmitters of the incorporation of oleate into the 
phospholipid of synaptic membranes.

Gullis RJ, Rowe CE.

Retraction in
    Rowe CE. Biochem J. 1977 Apr 15;164(1):287-8.

Noradrenaline stimulated the incorporation of oleate into choline
glycerophospholipids of guinea-pig brain synaptic membranes incubated in sodium
phosphate buffer. In the presence of 1 mm-NaF, noradrenaline stimulated the
incorporation of oleate into the choline glycerophospholipids,
phosphatidylinositol, ethanolamine glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylserine and
phosphatidic acid of synaptic membranes incubated in 10 mm-Tris-HCl buffer. In
Tris-CHl containing 1 mm-NaF, stimulation of incorporation of oleate into choline
glycerophospholipids by noradrenaline was enhanced by ATP, CaCl2, MgCl2 and CoA
plus dithiothreitol. The optimum concentration of CaCl2 for stimulation by 10
mum-noradrenaline was 10 mum. In the presence of CaCl2, the optimum concentration
of ATP-2MgCl2 was in the range 0.1-1 mm. Acetylcholine, carbamoylcholine,
5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, histamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid also
stimulated the incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids of
synaptic membranes. Sigmoidal dose-response curves were obtained, similar to
those obtained previously for stimulation by the same agonists of the hydrolysis 
of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase A2 (Gullis &amp; Rowe, 1975a). The initial
rate of transfer of oleate from oleoyl-CoA to choline glycerophospholipid was
similar to the initial rate of transfer from oleate-albumin, stimulated by
noradrenaline. Transfer of oleate from oleoyl-CoA was not appreciably stimulated 
by noradrenaline, but was stimulated by ATP and MgCl2.

The interaction of magnesium ions with teichoic acid.

Lambert PA, Hancock IC, Baddiley J.

The binding of Mg2+ to the wall teichoic acid of Lactobacillus buchneri N.C.I.B. 
8007 was measured by equilibrium dialysis at controlled ionic concentration and
pH. In an aqueous solution containing 10mM-NaCl at pH 5.0 one Mg2+ ion was bound 
for every two phosphate groups of the teichoic acid, with an apparent association
constant, Kassoc. = 2.7 x 10(3) M-1. On lowering the pH below the pKa of the
phosphate groups the amount of bound Mg2+ decreased concomitantly with decreasing
ionization of the phosphate groups. Both the amount of Mg2+ bound to the teichoic
acid and the apparent association constants were similar in the presence of 10 mM
concentrations of NaCl or KCl but decreased markedly in the presence of 10
mM-CaCl2 because of competition between Ca2+ and Mg2+ for the binding sites. A
similar effect was found when the concentration of NaCl was increased from 0 to
50 mM. The results are discussed in relation to the function of teichoic acid in 
the walls of Gram-positive bacteria.

The mechanism of hydrolysis of beta-glycerophosphate by kidney alkaline
phosphatase.

Ahlers J.

1. To identify the functional groups that are involved in the conversion of
beta-glycerophosphate by alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) from pig kidney, the
kinetics of alkaline phosphatase were investigated in the pH range 6.6-10.3 at
substrate concentrations of 3 muM-30 mM. From the plots of log VH+ against pH and
log VH+/KH+m against pH one functional group with pK = 7.0 and two functional
groups with pK = 9.1 were identified. These groups are involved in substrate
binding. Another group with pK = 8.8 was found, which in its unprotonated form
catalyses substrate conversion. 2. GSH inhibits the alkaline phosphatase
reversibly and non-competitively by attacking the bound Zn(II). 3. The influence 
of the H+ concentration on the activation by Mg2+ ions of alkaline pig kidney
phosphate was investigated between pH 8.4 and 10.0. The binding of substrate and 
activating Mg2+ ions occurs independently at all pH values between 8.4 and 10.0. 
The activation mechanism is not affected by the H+ concentration. The Mg2+ ions
are bound by a functional group with a pK of 10.15. 4. A scheme is proposed for
the reaction between enzyme, substrate, Mg2+ and H+ and the overall rate equation
is derived. 5. The mechanism of substrate binding and splitting by the functional
groups of the active centre is discussed on the basis of a model. Mg2+ seems to
play a role as an autosteric effector.

The pH-dependence and group modification of beta-lactamase I.

Waley SG.

The pH-dependence of the kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam
ring by beta-lactamase I (penicillinase, EC 3.5.2.6) was studied.
Benzylpenicillin and ampicillin (6-[D(-)-alpha-aminophenylacetamido]penicillanic 
acid) were used. Both kcat. and kcat./Km for both substrates gave bell-shaped
plots of parameter versus pH. The pH-dependence of kcat./Km for the two
substrates gave the same value (8.6) for the higher apparent pK, and so this
value may characterize a group on the free enzyme; the lower apparent pK values
were about 5(4.85 for benzylpenicillin, 5.4 for ampicillin). For benzylpenicillin
both kcat. and kcat./Km depended on pH in exactly the same way. The value of Km
for benzylpenicillin was thus independent of pH, suggesting that ionization of
the enzyme's catalytically important groups does not affect binding of this
substrate. The pH-dependence of kcat. for ampicillin differed, however,
presumably because of the polar group in the side chain. The hypothesis that the 
pK5 group is a carboxyl group was tested. Three reagents that normally react
preferentially with carboxyl groups inactivated the enzyme: the reagents were
Woodward's reagent K, a water-soluble carbodi-imide, and triethyloxonium
fluoroborate. These findings tend to support the idea that a carboxylate group
plays a part in the action of beta-lactamase I.

Oxidase-peroxidase enzymes of Datura innoxia. Oxidation of formylphenylacetic
acid ethyl ester.

Kalyanaraman VS, Mahadevan S, Kumar SA.

An enzyme system from Datura innoxia roots oxidizing formylphenylacetic acid
ethyl ester was purified 38-fold by conventional methods such as (NH4)2SO4
fractionation, negative adsorption on alumina Cy gel and chromatography on
DEAE-cellulose. The purified enzyme was shown to catalyse the stoicheiometric
oxidation of formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester to benzoylformic acid ethyl
ester and formic acid, utilizing molecular O2. Substrate analogues such as
phenylacetaldehyde and phenylpyruvate were oxidized at a very low rate, and
formylphenylacetonitrile was an inhilating agents, cyanide, thiol compounds and
ascorbic acid. This enzyme was identical with an oxidase-peroxidase isoenzyme.
Another oxidase-peroxidase isoenzyme which separated on DEAE-chromatography also 
showed formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester oxidase activity, albeit to a lesser
extent. The properties of the two isoenzymes of the oxidase were compared and
shown to differ in their oxidation and peroxidation properties. The oxidation of 
formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester was also catalysed by horseradish peroxidase.
The Datura isoenzymes exhibited typical haemoprotein spectra. The oxidation of
formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester was different from other peroxidase-catalysed
reactions in not being activated by either Mn2+ or monophenols. The oxidation was
inhibited by several mono- and poly-phenols and by catalase. A reaction mechanism
for the oxidation is proposed.

Purification of 2-oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase and its dependence on unusual amines.

Dunkerton J, James SP.

1. 2-Oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase was purified from sheep liver and gave one band on
polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. 2. The enzyme was completely dependent for
its activity on the presence of Tris or one of a number of related amines, all of
general structure: (See article). When more than one R group was hydrogen no
enzyme activity was observed. 3. Only one of these amines is known to exist in
living tissues and large concentrations of all amines were required for maximum
activity. L-2-Aminopropan-1-ol was the most effective amine on the basis of
substrate Km and Vmax. values and the amine Km values. 4. The enzyme was
activated by phosphate which lowered the Km values for methylglyoxal, amine and
NAD+. 5. The pH optimum of the enzyme was 9.3 and there was no activity at pH
values below 7.8. A search for activators that might produce activity at pH 7.4
proved unsuccessful. 6. The enzyme was inhibited by rather large concentrations
of barbiturates (6-46 mM) and nitro-alcohol analogues of the activating amines
(66-139 mM).

Determination of polyadenylate-rich ribonucleic acid in the nucleus and in the
cytoplasm of plasmacytoma cells.

Abraham KA, Eikhom TS.

A number of parameters affecting the adsorption of rRNA and poly(A)-containing
RNA to Millipore filters were investigated separately. Binding of both types of
RNA to the filter was dependent on the concentration of RNA, pH and Mg2+
concentration of the reaction mixture. Both types of RNA bound to the filter
optimally at slightly acid pH values. The binding of poly(A)-containing RNA to
the filter exhibited a broad pH-dependence compared with that of rRNA. The ratio 
of poly(A)-rich RNA/rRNA retained by the filter was maximal between pH7 and 8.
The presence of 1 mM-EDTA or a high concentration of NaCl (over 0.5M) decreased
the affinity of RNA for the filter. The amount of poly(A)-containing RNA in the
nucleus and in the cytoplasm of a plasmacytoma cell line (MPC-11) labelled with
[32P]Pi was determined by the Millipore-filter technique under conditions that
minimized contamination by rRNA. These data were compared with the estimations
made by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. The results obtained by these two
methods were in good agreement for RNA labelled for short periods (up to 2h). In 
long labelling and pulse-chase experiments, however, contamination of the filter 
by rRNA of increasing specific radioactivity in the cytoplasm gave an erroneous
value for poly(A)-containing RNA by the Millipore-filter technique.
Determinations made on the nuclear fraction by these two methods did not show
significant variation in short- and long-term labelling experiments.
