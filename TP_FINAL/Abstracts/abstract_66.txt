Partial purification and properties of a phenobarbital-induced aldehyde
dehydrogenase of rat liver.

Koivula T, Koivusalo M.

Properties of the phenobarbital induced cytoplasmic aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC
1.2.1.3) have been studied in rat liver. 7-12-Fold higher levels were seen in the
cytoplasmic activities after phenobarbital treatment in reactor compared to
non-reactor animals with high concentrations of acetaldehyde (18 mM) and
propionaldehyde (9 mM). No difference was found with 0.12 mM acetaldehyde, 2 mM
glycolaldehyde, 6 mM formaldehyde or 0.5 mM betaine aldehyde. The reactor group
also had slightly higher activity in the mitochondrial fraction with the high
acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde concentrations. In the microsomal fraction, the 
activities showed no differences at any substrate concentration. An induced
aldehyde dehydrogenase was purified 70-fold by chromatographic techniques. It had
different molecular and enzymic properties than the main high-Km enzyme normally 
present in rat liver cytoplasm. The pI of the induced enzyme was about 7.0 as
measured by isoelectric focusing. It was active with several aliphatic and
aromatic aldehydes but not with formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde or D-glyceraldehyde.
The Km-values for propionaldehyde and acetaldehyde were in the millimolar range. 
Millimolar concentrations of aromatic aldehydes caused a strong substrate
inhibition. The enzyme was inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of
disulfiram. Estrone, deoxycorticosterone, progesterone and diethylstilbestrol
also affected the enzyme activity.
