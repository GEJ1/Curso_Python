Hybrids of chemical derivatives of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase.

Meighen E, Yue R.

The activities of hybrid dimers of alkaline phosphatase containing two chemically
modified subunits have been investigated. One hybrid species was prepared by
dissociation and reconstitution of a mixture of two variants produced by chemical
modification of the native enzyme with succinic anhydride and tetranitromethane, 
respectively. The succinyl-nitrotyrosyl hybrid was separated from the other
members of the hybrid set by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography and then converted to a
succinyl-aminotyrosyl hybrid by reduction of the modified tyrosine residues with 
sodium dithionite. A comparison of the activities of these two hybrids with the
activities of the succinyl, nitrotyrosyl and aminotyrosyl derivatives has shown
that either the subunits of alkaline phosphatase function independently or if the
subunits turnover alternately in a reciprocating mechanism, then the intrinsic
activity of each subunit must be strongly dependent on its partner subunit.
