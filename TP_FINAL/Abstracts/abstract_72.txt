Preparation and characterization of an enzymatically active immobilized
derivative of myosin.

Elgart ES, Gusovsky T, Rosenberg MD.

Purified skeletal muscle myosin (EC 3.6.1.3) has been covalently bound to
Sepharose 4B by the cyanogen bromide procedure. The resulting complex,
Sepharose-Myosin, possesses adenosine triphosphatase activity and is relatively
stable for long periods of time. Under optimal binding conditions, approximately 
33% of the specific ATPase activity of the bound myosin is retained.
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of polypeptides released from denatured
Sepharose-Myosin indicates that 85% of the myosin is attached to the agarose
beads through the heavy chains and the remainder through the light chains, in
agreement with predictions of binding and release based upon either the lysine
contents or molecular weights of themyosin subunits. The adenosine triphosphatase
of the immobilized myosin has been investigated under conditions of varying pH,
ionic strength, and cation concentration. The ATPase profiles of immobilized
myosin are quite similar to those for free myosin, however subtle differences are
found. The Sepharose-Myosin ATPase is not as sensitive as myosin to alterations
in salt concentration and the apparent KM is approximately two-fold higher than
that of myosin. These differences are probably due to chemical modification in
the region of the attachment site(s) to the agarose beads and hydration and
diffusion limitations imposed by the polymeric agarose matrix.
