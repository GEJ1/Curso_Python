Lysosomal hydrolases of the epidermis. I. Glycosidases.

Mier PD, van den Hurk JJ.

Seven distinct glycosidases (EC 3.2) have been characterized in guinea-pig
epidermis. Their properties indicate them to be of lysosomal origin. The
'profile' of the epidermal glycosidases is significantly different from that
reported for whole skin, the activities of beta-galactosidase and
beta-acetylglucosaminidase being very high and those of the remaining enzymes
relatively low in epidermis.
