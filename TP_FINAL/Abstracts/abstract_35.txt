The effect of o-salicylate upon pentose phosphate pathway activity in normal and 
G6PD-deficient red cells.

Worathumrong N, Grimes AJ.

The effect of the major metabolite of aspirin, namely salicylic acid, upon the
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) of normal and G6PD-deficient red cells has been
studied. Salicylic acid was shown to inhibit this pathway in proportion to the
amount present. At any concentration of this substance there was greater
inhibition of the PPP in G6PD-deficient than in normal red cells.
