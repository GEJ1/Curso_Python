Bile acids. XLVII. 12alpha-Hydroxylation of precursors of allo bile acids by
rabbit liver microsomes.

Ali SS, Elliott WH.

Rabbit liver microsomal preparations fortified with 0.1 mM NADPH effectively
promote hydroxylation of [3beta-3H]- or [24-14C]allochenodeoxycholic acid or
[5alpha,6alpha-3H2]5alpha-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha-diol to their respective
12alpha-hydroxyl derivatives in yields of about 25 or 65% in 60 min. Minor
amounts of other products are formed from the diol. The requirements for activity
of rabbit liver microsomal 12alpha-hydroxylase resemble those of rat liver
microsomes. Of a number of enzyme inhibitors studied only p-chloromercuribenzoate
demonstrated a marked ability to inhibit the reaction with either tritiated
substrate. There was no difference in the quantity of product produced from the
tritiated acid or the 14C-labeled acid. No clear sex difference was found in
activity of the enzyme, nor was an appreciable difference noted in activity of
the enzyme between mature and immature animals.
