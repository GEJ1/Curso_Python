Partial purification and properties of microsomal phosphatidate phosphohydrolase 
from rat liver.

Caras I, Shapiro B.

Microsomal phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (phosphatidate phosphatase EC 3.1.3.4) 
was solubilized and fractionated to yield at least two distinct enzymatically
active fractions. One, denoted FA, was non-specific, had a relatively high Km for
phosphatidic acid and was insensitive to inhibition by diacylglycerol. The second
fraction, FB, was specific for phosphatidates, had a low Km, and was inhibited,
non-competitively, by diacylglycerol. FA exhibited a sigmoid substrate-activity
curve. The isolated FB aggregated to particles of about 10(6) in the absence of
salts and could be dissociated by the addition of monovalent cations at ionic
strength 0.4-0.6 to about 2-10(5) daltons and thereby doubled its activity.
Dissociation was time- and temperature-dependent. F- was inhibitory. Divalent
ions were not required for the activity of FA or FB and inhibited at
concentrations exceeding 1 mM.
