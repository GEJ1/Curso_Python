Yeast glutathione reductase. Studies of the kinetics and stability of the enzyme 
as a function of pH and salt concentration.

Moroff G, Brandt KG.

1. The pH dependencies of the apparent Michaelis constant for oxidized
glutathione and the apparent turnover number of yeast glutathione reductase (EC
1.6.4.2) have been determined at a fixed concentration of 0.1 mM NADPH in the
range pH 4.5--8.0. Between pH 5.5 and 7.6, both of these parameters are
relatively constant. The principal effect of low pH on the kinetics of the
enzyme-catalyzed reaction is the observation of a pH-dependent substrate
inhibition by oxidized glutathione at pH less than or equal 7, which is shown to 
correlate with the binding of oxidized glutathione to the oxidized form of the
enzyme. 2. The catalytic activity of yeast glutathione reductase at pH 5.5 is
affected by the sodium acetate buffer concentration. The stability of the
oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme at pH 5.5 and 25 degrees C in the
absence of bovine serum albumin was studied as a function of sodium acetate
concentration. The results show that activation of the catalytic activity of the 
enzyme at low sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium
acetate on a reduced form of the enzyme. In contrast, inhibition of the catalytic
activity of the enzyme at high sodium acetate concentration correlates with an
effect of sodium acetate on the oxidized form of the enzyme.
