Effects of membrane ribonuclease and 3'-nucleotidase on the digestion of
polyuridylic acid by rat liver plasma membrane.

Aronson NN Jr, Yannarell A.

1. Fragments of isolated rat liver plasma membrane possess a ribonuclease
activity which at pH 7.8 in the presence of 10 mM EDTA can digest polyuridylic
acid (poly(U)) and polycytidylic acid (poly(C)) but not polyadenylic acid
(poly(A)) and polyguanylic acid (poly(G)). Under these conditions, the membrane
preparation does not degrade native or denatured DNA. 2. The products of the
reaction with poly(U) (10 mM EDTA present) can be separated on DEAE-Sephadex into
oligonucleotides of increasing chain length. Most of the products are di- to
hexa-nucleotides which contain terminal 3'-phosphate groups. 3. When EDTA is not 
present (pH 7.8 or 8.8) the plasma membrane preparation degrades both poly(A) and
poly(U). With poly(A) the product is all nucleoside while with poly(U) as
substrate most of the product is nucleoside, but also some oligonucleotides are
produced. 4. The ribonuclease releases acid soluble products very slowly from
high concentrations of poly(U) (mg/ml). 5. Uridine trinucleotide with and without
a terminal 3'-phosphate group is degraded by rat liver plasma membrane. The
trinucleotide diphosphate is rapidly hydrolyzed to nucleoside while the
trinucleotide itself is slowly digested and yields intermediate products,
including nucleoside.
