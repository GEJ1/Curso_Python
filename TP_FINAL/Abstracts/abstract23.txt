Effect of etafenone on total and regional myocardial blood flow.

Flohr H, Breull W.

The distribution of blood flow to the subendocardial, medium and subepicardial
layers of the left ventricular free wall was studied in anaesthetized dogs under 
normoxic (A), hypoxic (B) conditions and under pharmacologically induced
(etafenone) coronary vasodilation (C). Regional myocardial blood flow was
determined by means of the particle distribution method. In normoxia a transmural
gradient of flow was observed, with the subendocardial layers receiving a
significantly higher flow rate compared with the subepicardial layers. In hypoxia
induced vasodilation this transmural gradient of flow was persistent. In contrast
a marked redistribution of regional flow was observed under pharmacologically
induced vasodilation. The transmural gradient decreased. In contrast to some
findings these experiments demonstrate that a considerable vasodilatory capacity 
exists in all layers of the myocardium and can be utilized by drugs. The
differences observed for the intramural distribution pattern of flow under
hypoxia and drug induced vasodilation support the hypothesis that this pattern
reflects corresponding gradients of regional myocardial metabolism.
