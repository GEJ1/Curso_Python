Light-induced changes of absorbance and electron spin resonance in small
photosystem II particles.

Van Gorkom HJ, Pulles MP, Wessels JS.

Photosystem II reaction center components have been studied in small system II
particles prepared with digitonin. Upon illumination the reduction of the primary
acceptor was indicated by absorbance changes due to the reduction of a
plastoquinone to the semiquinone anion and by a small blue shifts of absorption
bands near 545 nm (C550) and 685 nm. The semiquinone to chlorophyll ratio was
between 1/20 and 1/70 in various preparations. The terminal electron donor in
this reaction did not cause large absorbance changes but its oxidized form was
revealed by a hitherto unknown electron spin resonance (ESR) signal, which had
some properties of the well-known signal II but a linewidth and g-value much
nearer to those of signal I. Upon darkening absorbance and ESR changes decayed
together in a cyclic or back reaction which was stimulated by 3-(3,4
dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. The donor could be oxidized by ferricyanide in 
the dark. Illumination in the presence of ferricyanide induced absorbance and ESR
changes, rapidly reversed upon darkening, which may be ascribed to the oxidation 
of a chlorophyll a dimer, possibly the primary electron donor of photosystem II. 
In addition an ESR signal with 15 to 20 gauss linewidth and a slower dark decay
was observed, which may have been caused by a secondary donor.
