N-terminal spin label studies of hemoglobin, Ligand and pH dependence.

Giangrande M, Kim YW, Mizukami H.

Human hemoglobin was spin labeled with
4-isothiocanato-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperdinooxyl, which is known to bind
specifically to the N-terminal alpha-amino groups of proteins and slightly to the
reactive sulfhydryl groups. Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis indicated a
partially resolved five-line spectrum, suggesting that the label was attached to 
at least two different binding sites. Using specific blocking reagents prior to
spin labeling, the two binding sites were attributed to the sulfhydryl group of
beta-93 (immobile) and the alpha-amino group of the N-terminal valines (mobile). 
The relative motion of the spin at one set of binding sites was restricted
regardless of the state of ligation and pH, while the motion at the other site
showed dependence on those parameters, e.g. the spin-labeled N-terminal ends of
deoxyhemoglobin have restricted motion at all pH ranges studied, while those of
oxyhemoglobin are relatively free to move at the basic pH range, but become more 
restricted in the acidic pH range.
