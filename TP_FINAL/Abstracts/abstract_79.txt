Studies on electron transfer between mercury electrode and hemoprotein.

The electrochemical behaviour of ferricytochrome c, metmyoglobin and
methemoglobin was studied using d.c., a.c. and differential pulse polarography,
and controlled potential electrolysis. 1. The three hemoproteins yield d.c.
polarographic steps, and peaks in differential pulse polarograms, the height of
which is proportional to concentration. The charge transfer is influenced by
strong adsorption. 2. The concentration dependence of the a.c. polarograms
indicates structural changes in the adsorbed molecules. 3. The reduction products
of controlled potential electrolysis of metmyoglobin and methemoglobin have
absorption spectra identical with the native control samples. The affinity for
oxygen and the cooperativity in hemoglobin are not affected by the reaction at
the electrode. 4. The charge transfer proceeds via adsorbed, already reduced,
molecules to freely diffusible proteins.
