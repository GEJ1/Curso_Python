Polymer concentration dependence of the helix to random coil transition of a
charged polypeptide in aqueous salt solution.

Nitta K, Yoneyama M.

The helix to coil transition of poly(L-glutamic acid) was investigated in 0.05
and 0.005 M aqueous potassium chloride solutions by use of potentiometric
titration and circular dichroism measurement. Polymer concentration dependence of
the transition was observed in the range from 0.006 to 0.04 monomol/e in 0.005 M 
KG1 solution. The polymer concentration dependence can be interpreted by current 
theories of the transition of charged polypeptides and of titration curves of
linear weak polyelectrolytes taking the effect of polymer concentration into
consideration.
