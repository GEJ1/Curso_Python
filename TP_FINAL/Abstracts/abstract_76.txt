Multiple forms of casein kinase from rabbit erythrocytes.

Kumar R, Tao M.

Two rabbit erythrocyte casein kinases, GTP:casein kinase I and GTP:casein kinase 
II, have been purified 29 000- and 47 000-fold, respectively. Studies employing
sucrose density gradient centrifugation indicate that kinase I has a molecular
weight of about 9.5 - 10(5) (25 S) and kinase II about 1.4 - 10(6) (32 S). These 
enzymes can utilize either ATP or GTP as the phosphoryl donor. Among various
protein substrates examined, these kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of casein
greater than 50% dephosphorylated phosvitin congruent to 50% dephosphorylated
casein greater than phosvitin. Histones, protamine and bovine serum albumin are
poor phosphoryl acceptors. Kinetic data indicate that both enzymes are inhibited 
by high casein substrate concentrations which may be partially relieved by NaCl. 
Both phosphotransferases require Mg(2+) for activity and are optimally active at 
pH 9.0. The enzymes have apparent Km values of 2.5 - 10(-5) M for GTP, 2 - 10(-5)
M for ATP, and 0.4--0.6 mg/ml for casein. The incorporation of the terminal
phosphate of GTP into casein as catalyzed by these enzymes is inhibited to
varying degrees by ATP, ITP, ADP, and GDP but not by UTP, CTP, GMP, adenosine
3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, and guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. In
addition, NaF and 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid are also found to inhibit the
activity of both kinases. The effect of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is interesting and
suggests that this metabolite may regulate the activity of the casein kinases in 
the red blood cells.
