Specificity studies on alpha-mannosidases using oligosaccharides from
mannosidosis urine as substrates.

Hultberg B, Lundblad A, Masson PK, Ockerman PA.

Oligosaccharides containing terminal non-reducing alpha(1 leads to 2)-, alpha(1
leads to 3)-, and alpha(1 leads to 6)-linked mannose residues, isolated from
human and bovine mannosidosis urines were used as substrates to test the
specificities of acidic alpha-mannosidases isolated from human and bovine liver. 
The enzymes released all the alpha-linked mannose residues from each
oligosaccharide and were most effective on the smallest substrate. Enzyme A in
each case was less active on the oligosaccharides than alpha-mannosidase B2, even
though the apparent Km value for the substrates was the same with each enzyme.
The human acidic alpha-mannosidases were also found to be more active on
substrates isolated from human rather than bovine mannosidosis urine. Human
alpha-mannosidase C, which has a neutral pH optimum when assayed with a synthetic
substrate, did not hydrolyse any of the oligosaccharides at neutral pH, but was
found to be active at an acidic pH.
