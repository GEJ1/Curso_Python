Behavior of soluble and immobilized acid phosphatase in hydro-organic media.

Wan H, Horvath C.

The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate by wheat germ acid phosphatase
(orthophosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.2) has been investigated in
mixtures of aqueous buffers with acetone, dioxane and acetonitrile. The enzyme
was either in free solution or immobilized on a pellicular support which
consisted of a porous carbonaceous layer on solid glass beads. The highest enzyme
activity was obtained in acetone and acetonitrile mixed with citrate buffer over 
a wide range of organic solvent concentration. In 50% (v/v) acetone both V and Km
of the immobilized enzyme were about half of the values in the neat aqueous
buffer, but the Ki for inorganic phosphate was unchanged. In 50% (v/v) mixtures
of various solvents and citrate buffers of different pH, the enzymic activity was
found to depend on the pH of the aqueous buffer component rather than the pH of
the hydro-organic mixture as measured with the glass-calomel electrode. The
relatively high rates of p-nitrophenol liberation in the presence of glucose even
at high organic solvent concentrations suggest that transphosphorylation is
facilitated at low water activity.
