Cholinesterases from plant tissues. VI. Preliminary characterization of enzymes
from Solanum melongena L. and Zea mays L.

Fluck RA, Jaffe MJ.

Enzymes capable of hydrolyzing esters of thiocholine have been assayed in
extracts of Solanum melongena L. (eggplant) and Zea Mays L. (corn). The enzymes
from both species are inhibited by the anti-cholinesterases neostigmine,
physostigmine, and 284c51 and by AMO-1618, a plant growth retardant and they both
have pH optima near pH 8.0. The enzyme from eggplant is maximally active at a
substrate concentration of 0.15 mM acetylthiocholine and is inhibited at higher
substrate concentrations. On the basis of this last property, the magnitude of
inhibition by the various inhibitors, and the substrate specificity, we conclude 
that the enzyme from eggplant, but not that from corn, is a cholinesterase.
