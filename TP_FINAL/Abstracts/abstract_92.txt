Membrane-bound enzymes. III. Protease activity in leucocytes in relation to
erythrocyte membranes.

Heller M, Edelstein P, Mayer M.

Protease activity was detected in membranes of human bovine erythrocytes prepared
by the conventional procedures which include washing and removal of the "buffy
layer". The enzyme was extracted by 0.75 M KCNS or (NH4)2SO4 and was activated by
0.4 to 0.5 M of the same salts. Colored, particulate hide powder-azure, membrane 
fractions and soluble proteins such as hemoglobin, casein or albumin were
susceptible to hydrolysis by the membraneous protease. Partial purification of
the enzyme was accomplished through disc-gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide in
the presence of 0.25% positively charged detergents like cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide. An alkaline protease (pH 7.4) with properties similar to those of the
erythrocyte enzyme was found in leucocytes. The similarity between the properties
of the leucocytic and erythrocytic proteases and the correlation of the activity 
in erythrocyte membranes with content of white cells in these preparations,
suggest that enzymatic activities in the contaminating leucocytes are responsible
for the activity of membraneous proteases in erythrocytes.
