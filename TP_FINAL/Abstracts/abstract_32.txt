A serum haemagglutinating property dependent upon polycarboxyl groups.

Beck ML, Freihaut B, Henry R, Pierce S, Bayer WL.

A serum agglutinin reactive with red cells in the presence of polycarboxyl groups
is reported. It is likely that this represents an additional example of the type 
of agglutinin previously described as agglutinating red cells in the absence of
ionized calcium. Experimental evidence is presented indicating that it is free
polycarboxyl groups that potentiate agglutination and that any metal ion, such as
calcium, capable of chelating with these groups will prove to be inhibitory.
