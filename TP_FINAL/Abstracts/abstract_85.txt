Myosin from arterial smooth muscle: isolation following actin depolymerization.

Megerman J, Murphy RA.

The contractile proteins from arterial smooth muscle are highly soluble, and can 
be extracted at I = 0.05. However, they can be precipitated by a prolonged
dialysis at pH 6 to give an actomyosin with a high, although variable,
actin:myosin ratio. The sedimentation behavior of this actomyosin at high ionic
strength was examined as a function of pH, protein concentration and composition 
by preparative ultracentrifugation. Comparisons with synthetic skeletal muscle
actomyosins of similar composition demonstrated significant differences in the
behaviors of these two systems. It was found that much smooth muscle actomyosin
is not dissociated by normally relaxing conditions, and that it sediments at a
slower rate than F-actin. The solubility of the supernatant protein (a
myosin-enriched actomyosin) in 0.2 M K Cl (pH 7) depended on the pH during
centrifugation. A lower solubility was associated only with a higher actin
concentration in the supernatant, suggesting a dependence on actin
repolymerization. Pure myosin was selectively precipitated from the supernatant
by polyethylene glycol-6000, but only when the protein was soluble at low ionic
strength. The solubility of purified myosin was similar to that of myosin from
striated muscles. A relationship between the presence of depolymerized actin and 
the high solubility of smooth muscle contractile proteins is suggested.
