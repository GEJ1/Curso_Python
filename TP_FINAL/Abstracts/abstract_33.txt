Effect of human erythrocyte stromata on complement activation.

Corrocher R, Tedesco F, Rabusin P, De Sandre G.

Stroma from either normal or PNH-like red cells is capable of inhibiting, to some
extent, lysis in the sucrose test and enhancing lysis in the acidified-serum
test. The same opposing effects are displayed by the exclusion peaks from
Sephadex G-200 obtained from each stroma preparation, suggesting that the same
factor could be responsible for both activities. Stromata and peaks also induce
lysis of PNH-like cells in unacidified serum, indicating activation of complement
through the alternate pathway. This is confirmed by immunoelectrophoretic
observation. When serum previously activated through the alternate pathway is
used in the sucrose test the amount of lysis is markedly reduced. This would
indicate that the classical pathway activation can be controlled by the alternate
pathway. The possible clinical significance of these factors in determining the
haemolytic crisis in PNH patients is discussed.
