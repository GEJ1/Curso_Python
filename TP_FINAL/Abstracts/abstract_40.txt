Human brain and placental choline acetyltransferase: purification and properties.

Roskoski R Jr, Lim CT, Roskoski LM.

Choline acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6) catalyzes the biosynthesis of
acetylcholine according to the following chemical equation: acetyl-CoA + choline 
in equilibrium to acetylcholine + CoA. In addition to nervous tissue, primate
placenta is the only other animal source which contains appreciable acetylcholine
and its biosynthetic enzyme. Human brain caudate nucleus and human placental
choline acetyltransferase were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using
ion-exchange and blue dextran-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The molecular
weights determined by Sephadex G-150 gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate
gel electrophoresis are 67000 plus or minus 3000. N-Ethylmaleimide,
p-chloromercuribenzoate, and dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) inhibit the enzyme.
Dithiothreitol reverses the inhibition produced by the latter two reagents. The
pKa of the group associated with N-ethylmaleimide inhibition is 8.6 plus or minus
0.3. A chemically competent acetyl-thioenzyme is isolable by Sephadex gel
filtration. The enzymes from the brain and placenta are thus far physically and
biochemically indistinguishable.
