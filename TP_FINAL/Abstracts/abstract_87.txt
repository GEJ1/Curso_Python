Some physicochemical properties of hemoglobin-manitoba (alpha2 102Ser replaced by
Arg (G9) beta2).

Wrightstone RN, Smith LL, Wilson JB, Vella F, Huisman TH.

Hb-Manitoba was discovered in 1970 [1] in a Canadian family of British origin.
Recently we observed the same variant in a second family, and found that the
oxy-derivative of Hb-Manitoba is slightly unstable at 65 degrees C, dissociates
less readily at alkaline pH than does Hb-A, and forms asymmetric hybrids with
other hemoglobins which are readily detectable by electrophoresis.
