Results are presented of measuring fibrinogen fluorescence parameters in
temperature range of 20-80 degrees C at different pH of the solution. It was
found that the temperature increase from 20 to 40 degrees C for solutions with pH
of 4,5-9,3 were not accompanied by the conformational changes of fibrinogen
macromolecules. In the temperature range of 40-50 degrees C for neutral solutions
conformational reconstruction of fibrinogen of undenatured character took place. 
Temperature increase above 50-55 degrees C brings about significant structural
changes of fibrinogen molecule which are of denaturation nature.
