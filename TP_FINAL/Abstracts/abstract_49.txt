The interaction of bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase with hydrogen
peroxide: inactivation of the enzyme.

Hodgson EK, Fridovich I.

Bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase was slowly and irreversibly inactivated
by hydrogen peroxide. The rate of this inactivation was directly dependent upon
the concentrations of both H2O2 and of enzyme, and its second-order rate constant
at pH 10.0 and 25 degrees was 6.7 M-1 sec-1. Inactivation was preceded by a
bleaching due to rapid reduction of Cu2+ on the enzyme, and following this there 
was a gradual reappearance of a new absorption in the visible region, which was
coincident with the loss of catalytic activity. Inactivation of the enzyme was
pH-dependent and indicated an essential ionization whose pKa was approximately
10.2. Replacement of H2O by D2O raised this pKa but did not diminish the
catalytic activity of superoxide dismutase, measured at pH 10.0. Several
compounds, including xanthine, urate, formate, and azide, protected the enzyme
against inactivation by H2O2. Alcohols and benzoate, which scavenge hydroxyl
radical, did not protect. Compounds with special affinity for singlet oxygen were
similarly ineffective. The data were interpreted in terms of the reduction of the
enzyme-bound Cu2+ to Cu+, by H2O2, followed by a Fenton's type reaction of the
Cu+ with additional H2O2. This would generate Cu2+-OH- or its ionized equivalent,
Cu2+-O--, which could then oxidatively attack an adjacent histidine and thus
inactivate the enzyme. Compounds which protected the enzyme could have done so by
reacting with the bound oxidant, in competition with the adjacent histidine.
