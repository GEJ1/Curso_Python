[Article in German]

Isaac O, Thiemer K.

(--)-alpha-Bisabolol has a primary antipeptic action depending on dosage, which
is not caused by an alteration of the pH-value. The proteolytic activity of
pepsin is reduced by 50 percent through addition of bisabolol in the ratio of
1/0.5. The antipeptic action of bisabolol only occurs in case of direct contact. 
In case of a previous contact with the substrate, the inhibiting effect is lost.
