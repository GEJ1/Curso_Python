Modification of arginine and lysine in proteins with 2,4-pentanedione.

Gilbert HF 3rd, O'Leary MH.

Primary amines react with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 6-9 to form enamines,
N-alkyl-4-amino-3-penten-2-ones. The latter compounds readily regenerate the
primary amine at low pH or on treatment with hydroxylamine. Guanidine and
substituted guanidines react with 2,4-pentanedione to form N-substituted
2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidines at a rate which is lower by at least a factor of 
20 than the rate of reaction of 2,4-pentanedione with primary amines. Selective
modification of lysine and arginine side chains in proteins can readily be
achieved with 2,4-pentanedione. Modification of lysine is favored by reaction at 
pH 7 or for short reaction times at pH 9. Selective modification of arginine is
achieved by reaction with 2,4-pentanedione for long times at pH 9, followed by
treatment of the protein with hydroxylamine. The extent of modification of lysine
and arginine side chains can readily be measured spectrophotometrically.
Modification of lysozyme with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 7 results in modification of
3.8 lysine residues and less than 0.4 arginine residue in 24 hr. Modification of 
lysozyme with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 9 results in modification of 4 lysine
residues and 4.5 arginine residues in 100 hr. Treatment of this modified protein 
with hydroxylamine regenerated the modified lysine residues but caused no change 
in the modified arginine residues. One arginine residue seems to be essential for
the catalytic activity of the enzyme.
