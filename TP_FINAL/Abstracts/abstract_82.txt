The behavior of holo- and apo-forms of bovine superoxide dismutase at low pH.

Fee JA, Phillips WD.

1. Holo-superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes has been shown to undergo a
reversible structural modification in the pH 3-5 range. 2. The spectral
alterations observed on changing from neutrality to pH 2 were: a slight
attenuation of the 680 nm absorbance; the loss of the 450 nm shoulder, apparent
in the optical spectrum of the native protein; and a new band appeared at 330 nm.
The circular dichroism at 600 nm was essentially lost while a weak negative band 
appeared at approx. 380 nm and a positive band at 310 nm. 3. The EPR spectrum was
also modified on changing from the native to the low pH form: A parallel
increased from approximately 130 to approximately 150 G, g parallel remained
unchanged at approximately 2.27, and gm decreased from approximately 2.09 to
approximately 2.08. The apparent linewidth remained essentially constant. 4. High
resolution (220 MHz) PMR spectra of holo- and apoproteins revealed that the
metals influence the three-dimensional structure of the protein. 5. PMR studies
indicated that at pH 3 the apoprotein existed almost entirely in a random coil
form and that it assumed a compact well-ordered structure on returning to neutral
pH. The holoprotein maintained a compact, apparently dimeric, structure even at
pH 3.
