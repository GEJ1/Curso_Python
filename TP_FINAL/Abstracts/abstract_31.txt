Lysosomal hydrolases of the epidermis. 2. Ester hydrolases.

Mier PD, van den Hurk JJ.

Five distinct ester hydrolases (EC 3-1) have been characterized in guinea-pig
epidermis. These are carboxylic esterase, acid phosphatase, pyrophosphatase, and 
arylsulphatase A and B. Their properties are consistent with those of lysosomal
enzymes.
