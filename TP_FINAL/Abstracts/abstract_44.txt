The origin of the alkaline inactivation of pepsinogen.

McPhie P.

Above pH 8.5, pepsinogen is converted into a form which cannot be activated to
pepsin on exposure to low pH. Intermediate exposure to neutral pH, however,
returns the protein to a form which can be activated. Evidence is presented for a
reversible, small conformational change in the molecule, distinct from the
unfolding of the protein. At the same time, the molecule is converted to a form
of limited solubility, which is precipitated at low pH, where activation is
normally seen. The results are interpreted in terms of the peculiar structure of 
the pepsinogen molecule. Titration of the basic NH2-terminal region produced an
open form, which can return to the native form at neutral pH, but which is
maintained at low pH by neutralization of carboxylate groups in the pepsin
portion.
