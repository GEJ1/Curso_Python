The interaction of phospholipase A2 with micellar interfaces. The role of the
N-terminal region.

van Dam-Mieras MC, Slotboom AJ, Pieterson WA, de Haas GH.

The localization of the previously postulated interface recognition site (IRS) in
porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2, required for a specific interaction between 
the enzyme and organized lipid-water interfaces, was investigated by ultraviolet 
difference spectroscopy, by measurements of the intrinsic fluorescence of the
unique Trp residue, and by protection experiments against specific tryptic
hydrolysis. Using the enzymically nondegradable substrate analogues:
CnH(2n+1)(0-)OOCH2CH2N+(CH3)3-(H,OH), it is shown that the rather hydrophobic
N-terminal sequence of the enzyme, viz., Ala-Leu-Trp-Gln-Phe-Arg, is directly
involved in the interaction with the lipid-water interface. Besides hydrophobic
probably also polar interactions contribute to the binding process. At neutral or
acidic pH the presence of a salt bridge between the N-terminal alpha-NH3+ group
and a negatively charged side chain stablizes the interface recognition site and 
allows the enzyme to penetrate micellar surfaces, even in the absence of metal
ion. At alkaline pH, interaction of the enzyme with micellar interfaces requires 
the presence of Ca2+ (Ba2+) ions.
