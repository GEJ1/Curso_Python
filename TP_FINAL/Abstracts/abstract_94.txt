The fluorescence probe(4-dimethylaminochalcone; DMH) was noncovalently linked to 
human serum albumin (HSA). The variation of pH was due to serum albumin
structural changes, which was determined in terms of DMH and HSA fluorescence and
CD spectra. Considerable changes of fluorescence and CD spectra were observed at 
pH 8 and 10, where there is ionization of two more recently titrated tyrosin
residues. It is assumed that these two tyrosine residues are in binding region
and quench the fluorescence of DMH between pH 4 to 8. Quenching disappears if
these residues are ionized (pH greater than 8) or if the protein undergoes the N 
-F transition (pH less than 4).
