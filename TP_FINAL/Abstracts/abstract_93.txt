In connection with the modelling of biomembranes regularities of the formation
and development of interphase adsorption layers of lysozyme at liquid borders
under different conditions and depending on the nature of carbohydrate phase were
investigated by the determination of mechanical characteristics of such layers.
The investigations carried out showed that the most solid layers appeared under
the conditions which assured the formation of the maximum number of
intermolecular bonds (which in a common case is performed with maximum
disorderlinesss of the macromolecules which get at the interphase).
