Enzymic reactions of fatty acid hydroperoxides in extracts of potato tuber. II.
Conversion of 9- and 13-hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acids to monohydroxydienoic
acid, epoxyhydroxy- and trihydroxymonoenoic acid derivatives.

1. Crude extracts and partially purified enzyme preparations from potato tubers
catalyse, at pH 5-7, the conversion of linoleic acid hydroperoxides to a range of
oxygenated fatty acid derivatives. 2. 9-D- and 13-L-hydroperoxide isomers are
converted at similar rates to equivalent (isomeric) products. 3. The major
products from the 13-hydroperoxide isomer were identified as the corresponding
monohydroxydienoic acid derivative,
threo-11-hydroxy-trans12,13-epoxy-octadec-cis9-enoic acid and
9,12,13-trihydroxy-octadec-trans10-enoic acid. The corresponding products from
the 9-hydroperoxide were the monohydroxydienoic acid,
9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-octadec-12-enoic acid and
9,10,13-trihydroxy-octadec-11-enoic acid. 4. No separation of activities forming 
the different products was achieved by partial purification of enzyme extracts.
5. Product formation was unaffected by EDTA, CN-, sulphydryl reagents or
glutathione but was reduced by boiling the extracts. 6. This system is compared
with the 9-hydroperoxide-specific enzymic formation of divinyl ether derivatives 
by potato extracts.
