Identification of the 120 mus phase in the decay of delayed fluorescence in
spinach chloroplasts and subchloroplast particles as the intrinsic back reaction.
The dependence of the level of this phase on the thylakoids internal pH.

Haveman J, Lavorel J.

After a 500 mus laser flash a 120 mus phase in the decay of delayed fluorescence 
is visible under a variety of circumstances in spinach chloroplasts and
subchloroplast particles enriched in Photosystem II prepared by means of
digitonin. The level of this phase is high in the case of inhibition of oxygen
evolution at the donor side of Photosystem II. Comparison with the results of
Babcock and Sauer (1975) Biochim. Bio-phys. Acta 376, 329-344, indicates that
their EPR signal IIf which they suppose to be due to Z+, the oxidized first
secondary donor of Photosystem II, is well correlated with a large amplitude of
our 120 mus phase. We explain our 120 mus phase by the intrinsic back reaction of
the excited reaction center in the presence of Z+, as predicted by Van Gorkom and
Donze (1973) Photochem. Photobiol. 17, 333-342. The redox state of Z+ is
dependent on the internal pH of the thylakoids. The results on the effect of pH
in the mus region are compared with those obtained in the ms region.
