Calcium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase in the microsomal fraction of tooth
germ from porcine fetus.

Yoshimura F, Suzuki T.

The characterization and localization of a Ca(2+)-ATPase (ATP phosphohydrolase,
EC 3.6.1.3) in the tooth germ of the porcine fetus are reported. This enzyme, a
microsome fraction, is preferentially activated by Ca(2+). In the presence of 0.5
mM ATP, maximal enzyme activity is obtained at 0.5--1.0 mM CaCl2. The maximal
rate of ATP hydrolysis is approx. 20 mumol per h per mg of protein as the enzyme 
preparation is used here. At optimal Ca(2+) concentration, the Mg(2+) has an
inhibitory effect. The enzyme does not require Na+ or/and K+ for activation by
Ca(2+). Other nucleotide triphosphates may serve as the substrate, but V for ATP 
is the highest. The Km for ATP is 8.85 - 10(-5) M. The optimal pH for Ca(2+)
activation of the enzyme lies around 9.2. Well known inhibitors of (Na+ +
K+)-ATPase, mitochondria ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase in the erthrocyte do not
inhibit the enzyme. In the subcellular order the enzyme may be assumed to be
localized in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum fraction containing cell and Golgi 
body membrane fragments and in the tissue order in the enamel organ containing an
ameloblast layer, stratum intermedium and stellate reticulum.
