Studies on rat renal cortical cell kallikrein. I. Separation and measurement.

Kaizu T, Margolius HS.

A technique has been developed to separate and measure kallikrein in a
heterogeneous population of rat renal cortical cells in suspension. After rat
kidneys were perfused in situ in anaesthetized rats, viable, counted cortical
cell suspensions were obtained. Cells were suspended in a sucrose/Tris buffer
containing 0.5% deoxycholate, homogenized, centrifuged, dialyzed, and gel
filtered on Sephadex G-25. Column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose resulted in a 
single peak of esterase activity between 0.20 to 0.25 M NaCl/sodium phosphate
buffer. Subsequent elution yielded an alkaline esterase which was identical to
kallikrein isolated from rat urine, insofar as pH optimum, effects of inhibitors,
bioassay activity and immunological properties were concerned. Calculated yields 
were about 70% of the total esterase activity present in the parent cell
homogenates. Recoveries of a purified rat urinary kallikrein added to the cell
homogenates, the DEAE-cellulose columns, or the eluates from the columns ranged
from 83-108% (mean 96%). Using this technique, it was found that the amount of
kallikrein activity present in non-incubated renal cortical cells ranged from
0.6-10(-2) to 4.6 - 10(-2) alpha-N-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (Tos-Arg-OMe)
esterase units per 10(8) cells. However, cells incubated in a nutrient medium at 
37 degrees C for 3-8 h contained no measurable kallikrein activity, whereas the
surrounding medium had kallikrein activity which could be significantly increased
by aldosterone and decreased by spironolactone.
